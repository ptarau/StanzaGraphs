-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Oprah Winfrey gave her support to those suffering in the Gulf states , saying President Obama is doing the best he can to handle the oil disaster . 
   What 's going on in my heart is the same thing , everyone feels for what is happening to all of the fisherman and families who , this time of year , would be hosting people from all over the country and all over the world there , ' said Winfrey , who was in Atlanta , Georgia , on Wednesday to speak at a middle school graduation . 
   We can only hope and pray that this will soon be resolved in a way that people can pick themselves up and move forward , ' Winfrey added . 
The talk show host said she has heard the criticism of Obama 's handling of the oil crisis . Winfrey , an avid supporter of the president , said he is doing a good job . 
   I think the president is doing the best anybody can , ' said Winfrey , who campaigned for Obama when he ran for president .    I really do n't understand what people want him to do ? I think he 's the president of the United States . 
   You 're not supposed to be emotional , you 're supposed to take action and get things done and make sure those things happen so I 'm not sure what people want him to do , ' she said . 
The underwater gusher began after an April 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon . The explosion and subsequent fire caused the rig to sink two days later , rupturing the pipes and sending oil spilling from the well .
