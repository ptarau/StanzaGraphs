LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With Manchester United continuing their top form from last season and aiming for what would be a remarkable clean sweep of trophies this year , it 's only appropriate that we should profile a blog somehow linked to the Red Devils . 
Fan focus : The Republik of Mancunia blog is popular with Manchester United supporters . 
The Republik of Mancunia blog focuses on the Old Trafford club and is updated daily with a keen following among thousands of Manchester United fans . 
Authored by Manchester-born and raised 25-year-old Scott -LRB- who prefers to remain anonymous -RRB- , the blog began in the 2005-2006 season . 
Scott , also known as    Scott the Red , ' told CNN that before starting the blog he had been published on several football sites , and then    fell into ' creating the Republik of Mancunia web site . 
   I love talking about United and I 'm an argumentative guy , so getting to write my opinions down about the latest goings on is something I really enjoy doing . 
' -LRB- In 2005-2006 -RRB- I was also getting on soapbox about the fact we were not in decline , which the current media at the time seemed to think we were , ' he said . 
Scott said running a blog was a very difficult and time-consuming task , though he enjoyed the interaction with other fans . 
   I imagine if I was n't in love with the club , I 'd have given up on it long before now . It takes up a lot of time and you get people who support other teams having a go at you on a daily basis , sometimes United fans and all ! ' 
Scott said the readership of his blog , and also contributions to his Manchester United forum came from areas as widely spread as Europe , Africa and even as far as Asia and South America -- with a strong base at home in the United Kingdom . 
   I find it odd thinking of some lads thousands of miles away and hours apart sat at a computer and reading my latest rant . I like it though ! '
