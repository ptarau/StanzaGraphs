-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The crane operator facing charges over a deadly building collapse was denied bail Sunday . 
A Philadelphia judge refused to allow Sean Benschop , 42 , to leave jail . 
He is charged with six counts of involuntary manslaughter , 13 counts of recklessly endangering another person , and one count of    risking a catastrophe , ' District Attorney spokeswoman Tasha Jamerson told CNN . 
Wednesday 's building collapse in downtown Philadelphia left six dead and 13 people injured . 
Benschop , who maintains his innocence , turned himself in Saturday . 
   My client is being made the scapegoat in this situation , ' said Daine Grey , Benschop 's attorney . 
   The victims here are n't just those who died and their families . My client is a victim as well . He 's currently being looked at as the cause of everybody 's pain , but that just is n't the case . ' 
Grey told reporters Saturday that while his client feels    extremely sympathetic and remorseful , ' he is not guilty . 
   This was an accident , but Mr. Benschop was not responsible , ' Grey said , in remarks captured by CNN affiliate WPVI .    And we believe that , in time , the facts will show that he is not responsible . ' 
Benschop had marijuana and pain medication in his blood after the collapse , a law enforcement source told CNN . 
Pennsylvania court records indicate Benschop , who also went by the alias Kary Roberts , has been arrested multiple times in the past two decades . Many of the related charges -- related to alleged firearms violations and theft -- were withdrawn , dismissed or resulted in not guilty verdicts , though he was found guilty in the mid-1990s on drug charges . 
Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter blamed Benschop 's    reckless and irresponsible behavior ' for the building collapse and said Saturday he hopes that Benschop faces    the harshest level of charges ... and he is punished accordingly . ' 
   Justice will only be served if Sean Benschop receives a sentence that buries him in a jailhouse forever , just like his victims were buried on Wednesday , ' Nutter said . 
Nutter is pressing for answers from two property owners who hired Benschop to operate heavy machinery , saying that , along with Benschop , they    bear the ultimate and sole responsibility for this tragedy . ' 
Benschop allegedly was working a crane to tear down a vacant building in downtown Philadelphia when a four-story wall collapsed onto a Salvation Army thrift store , causing an ominous rumble followed by panic on the streets . 
Afterward , searchers climbed over shards of wood , concrete and rebar looking for survivors , such as a 61-year-old woman pulled alive from the rubble early Thursday . 
The first lawsuit against him was filed that same day , by attorneys for a 54-year-old woman pulled from the rubble by a firefighter .
