   Words can not express the sorrow I feel , ' said a statement that was read by Willis . 
  Never saw them  
Kokomoor said that he was losing altitude fast and had little time to make a decision . He said he aimed for an area on the water 's edge that appeared to be remote . 
   I never saw them , ' he said .    It was only after I landed and we exited the plane that I realized that there were people on the beach . ' 
The investigation into the crash is being conducted by the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board . 
The death investigation -- which is being conducted by the sheriff 's office -- will determine if Kokomoor will face any charges , said Rose . 
   I send my heartfelt apologies to the Irizarry family for my role in this tragic accident , ' the statement read .    I will fully cooperate with the FAA and NTSB in their investigations . '
