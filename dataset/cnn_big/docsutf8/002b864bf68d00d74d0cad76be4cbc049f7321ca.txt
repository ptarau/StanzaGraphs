The gunman who held hostages for more than 16 hours in a Sydney cafe was no stranger to police -- and was on bail for violent criminal offenses at the time of the siege . 
Man Haron Monis , an Iranian-born refugee who was granted political asylum in Australia in 2001 , had    a long history of violent crime , infatuation with extremism and mental instability , ' Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters . 
   It 's pretty obvious that the perpetrator was a deeply disturbed individual , ' he said at a press conference Tuesday , adding that the 50-year-old was    well known ' to federal and state police , as well as the Australian Security Intelligence Organization . 
   But I do n't believe he was on a terror watch list at this time . ' 
New South Wales Premier Mike Baird said authorities were investigating why Monis -- who was killed in the siege -- was at large , given his criminal background . 
   We 're all outraged that this guy was on the street , ' he told reporters .    We need to understand why he was . We also need to understand why he was n't picked up . ' 
What we know , what we do n't know 
Accessory to murder , sex charges 
The self-styled Muslim cleric , also known as Sheikh Haron , was facing dozens of charges at the time of the siege , including two counts of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife , according to the Attorney General of New South Wales . 
Noleen Hayson Pal was found dead with multiple stab wounds in a stairwell , and her body had been set on fire , The Sydney Morning Herald reported . 
   They should have put him away and thrown away the key , ' the dead woman 's godfather , Ayyut Khalik , told NBC News . He said Monis used to beat Pal , forcing her to wear a hijab all the time and forbidding her from talking to    outsiders . ' 
Court documents show Monis was also facing 45 sex-related charges , including sexual intercourse without consent and aggravated indecent assault . 
According to the Sydney Morning Herald , the initial charges , laid in May 2014 , related to an alleged sexual assault on a woman in western Sydney in 2002 , before other sex-related charges were added regarding six additional victims . 
Monis was using the name Mohammad Hassan Manteghi -- his birth name , according to Iran 's state news agency IRNA -- and claimed to be a    healer , ' according to the report . 
Monis also pleaded guilty last year to writing offensive    poison pen ' letters to the families of Australian soldiers who died in Afghanistan , and was sentenced to 300 hours of community service . The letters were    sadistic , wantonly cruel and deeply wounding , ' one High Court judge said at the time , according to CNN affiliate Seven News . 
But the criminal accusations against him began even before he came to Australia . 
Monis fled his homeland in 1995 while being sought for allegedly committing fraud , Iran 's semi-official Fars News reported . 
A spokesperson at Iran 's embassy in Canberra told CNN that Tehran had officially requested Monis 's extradition but nothing had come of it . Monis had been granted political asylum in 2001 and had had no further contact with his birth country , the spokesperson said . 
Who were the victims ? 
An extremist theology 
Manny Conditsis , a lawyer who acted for Monis in relation to the accessory to murder and letter-writing charges , told CNN his former client had been a cleric in Shiite Iran , but had become critical of the Islamic Republic 's government in the late 1990s , and fled to Australia    because he was going to be killed . ' 
He had left behind a wife and two children , who he believed Monis had not seen since . 
Throughout the 2000s , said Conditsis , Monis    became sympathetic to what he perceived ... was the victimization of Muslims and Islamists around the world , and partly at least took up that cause . ' 
His broader cause , he said , was lobbying governments around the world , particularly Australia , not to wage wars on Muslim soil . 
   He was so blinded by that objective that it would seem he had lost sight of objectivity and rationality and acted in extreme ways , ' he said , describing his former client as    intensely conflicted and contradicted and inconsistent . ' 
While older footage of Monis preaching shows him dressed in typical Shiite cleric 's attire , in his social media posts , he appears to embrace a radical Sunni extremist theology . 
He used the Internet to spread extremist beliefs , garnering nearly 13,000 likes on his Facebook page . 
During the siege , Abbott said , the hostage-taker    sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the -LRB- ISIS -RRB- death cult , ' Abbott said . 
On his website , which has now been taken down , there was a pledge of allegiance to the so-called Islamic State terror group . 
The site describes Monis as a Muslim cleric and activist based in Sydney who has    continuously been under attack & false accusation by the Australian government & media since he started his political letter campaign from 2007 . ' 
There 's a graphic photo of slain children at the top of the site . Under the image , it reads ,    This is an evidence for the terrorism of America and its allies including Australia . The result of their airstrikes . ' 
A description on the site portrayed Monis as a victim of a political vendetta and compares him to Julian Assange , the WikiLeaks founder who has claimed the sex crime allegations he faces are politically motivated . 
A YouTube video posted in November shows Monis standing on a street corner , chains draped over him , carrying a sign that says ,    I have been tortured in prison for my political letters . ' 
Police have refused to comment on that accusation . 
His last tweet linked to his website , with a haunting message posted the day of his attack on the Sydney cafe :    If we stay silent towards the criminals we can not have a peaceful society . The more you fight with crime , the more peaceful you are . ' 
Conditsis told Australian public broadcaster ABC that Monis was an isolated figure who was probably acting alone . 
Crisis in a cafe 
Monday 's hostage situation began around 10 a.m. Hundreds of police officers , including snipers , took position around the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Sydney 's central business district . 
Australian media captured haunting images of hostages pressing their hands against the cafe 's windows . They were reportedly taking turns holding a black flag with Arabic writing on it that said ,    There is no God but God and Mohammed is the prophet of God . ' 
The man holding the hostages demanded to speak to Abbott . Police were monitoring social media because hostages appeared to be posting information about the man 's demands . 
Hours into the crisis , at least five hostages managed to escape , running terrified toward police in riot gear . That made the hostage-taker furious , reported Chris Reason , a correspondent for CNN affiliate Seven Network . Reason said he could see the gunman become    extremely agitated ' when he realized what had happened , and he    started screaming orders ' at the remaining hostages . 
Gunfire erupted early Tuesday as police stormed the cafe where the gunman had been holding hostages . 
Two hostages were killed during the standoff . Police later announced that the siege was over and that the lone gunman had been killed .
