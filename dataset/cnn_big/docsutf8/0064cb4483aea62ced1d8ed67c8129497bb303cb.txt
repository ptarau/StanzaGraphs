-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ah , fandom , it 's a curious and wonderful thing . When it was announced last year that we would be getting a Green Day version of    Rock Band , ' fans of the band -LRB- myself included -RRB- were pretty excited . 
The band that helped turn the '90s punk-rock revival into a more mainstream , pop-radio movement would be getting some major attention in the digital world . 
When the game was released on Tuesday , I could n't wait to get home and see if I could play like Tre Cool or sing like Billie Joe Armstrong . 
But with so many other versions of    Rock Band ' out there , why would you want to spend money on this game ? 
Well , for starters , any fanboy or fangirl will love the loading screens with Green Day specific graphics and sounds . You also get to view cool memorabilia , like still photos and rare video footage of the band , for completing songs in career mode . 
Playing songs like    When I Come Around ' and    Pulling Teeth ' brings back memories of college days , and yes , I will admit I wish they had put    All By Myself ' in the game , because it 's the only hidden track that Green Day has ever included on an album . Maybe an Easter egg is hiding in the shadows for us to discover ? 
There are also unique drum lessons written specifically for this version of the game . From what I 've seen , even veteran Rock Band players will need them . 
Most of the songs included in the game are ones that fans of Green Day can listen to again and again . Now we can also tell our friends ,    yeah , I five-starred   Brain Stew/Jaded !  ' 
Hardcore    Rock Band ' fans have posted videos on YouTube of themselves playing in expert mode and achieving five gold stars , which is something that not even the members of Green Day were able to do , according to a recent interview with MTV . 
The graphics are really well done in this game and the motion-capture technique used to animate the Green Day doppelganger is pretty impressive . When the piano opening to    Viva La Gloria -LRB- Little Girl -RRB- ' starts playing , Billie Joe encourages the audience to clap and fakes surprise when the piano stops before the song kicks into high gear . It 's almost like being at a concert -- I nearly forgot I was supposed to start singing . 
Also notable is that the band 's clothing choices match the theme and era of each album .    21st Century Breakdown ' has an almost steampunk feel to it . In the Oakland venue the band is decked out in waistcoats , trousers and pin-striped shirts to match the vibe of the album . 
As with most of the    Rock Band ' games , when you earn four stars or more on a song , you get a reward . In this case , you get    cred ' instead of    fans ' and with that the ability to open up more sets with tougher songs like    Peacemaker ' from    21st Century Breakdown ' -- a fun , fast-paced song about death and destruction . 
All the members of Green Day play an instrument and sing at the same time , which is no small feat given the technical difficulty of the bass lines and Tre Cool 's blazing fast drumming speed . My other    band mate ' was busy clacking away on his guitar and would n't have been able to sing if he tried , nor would I when behind my electronic drum kit . 
Sore arms and scratchy voice aside ,    Green Day : Rock Band ' is a lot of fun . Fans both new and old will enjoy playing along with their favorite songs . We may not all be able to unlock achievements like    It 's All Fun Until Someone Gets Hurt ' or    Louder Than Bombs or Eternity , ' but we 'll have fun trying .
