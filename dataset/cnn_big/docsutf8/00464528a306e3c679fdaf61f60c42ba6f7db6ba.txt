Boko Haram , which means    Western education is sacrilege ' in the Hausa-Fulani language , seeks to impose a strict version of Sharia law across northeastern Nigeria , if not the entire country . 
The group has attacked various targets in the West African nation since its formation in the late 1990s , according to the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center , including killing and kidnapping Westerners , and bombing schools and churches . 
Hundreds of its members , including its leader Mohammed Yusuf , died in July 2009 clashes with government forces . But the group did not stay down for long , and has remained an active and violent force in Nigeria .
