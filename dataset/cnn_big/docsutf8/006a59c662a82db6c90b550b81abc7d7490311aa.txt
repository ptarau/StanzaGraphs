-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The hostage crisis in eastern Algeria is over , but the questions remain . 
Among them , exactly how many people are unaccounted for at a remote natural gas facility after three days of chaos that ended Saturday , leaving at least 23 hostages and dozens of Islamist militants dead . 
Some 685 Algerian workers and 107 foreigners were freed , the Algerian Interior Ministry said . 
Britain 's BP said Sunday four of its workers remain unaccounted for . And Norway 's Statoil said five of its employees were missing , while 12 others are now home in Norway , Algeria and Canada . 
   Search efforts are ongoing at the gas installation , looking for more possible victims . I fear the numbers will be updated with more victims later today when the search operation is expected to end , ' said Mohammed Said , Algeria 's communication minister . 
The attackers came from six countries -- only three were Algerian -- and included Arabs and Africans , Said told state-run Radio Algeria . Algeria 's military found numerous    foreign military uniforms ' in its sweep of the In Amenas facility , its Interior Ministry said . 
Mauritania 's Sahara Media news agency said Sunday it had a video from Moktar Belmoktar , who leads the Al-Mulathameen Brigade associated with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb that regional media have reported was behind the attack . 
In it , Belmoktar said ,    We at al Qaeda are claiming responsibility of this blessed guerrilla operation . ' 
Belmoktar has communicated with this and other news sites before , said Andrew Lebovich , a Senegal-based security analyst . But the news agency did not post the video , and CNN has not independently confirmed its authenticity . 
Eleven former hostages -- among them British citizens -- have gotten medical treatment and psychological counseling from the U.S. military at a U.S. naval base in Sigonella , Italy , a U.S. official said Sunday . The hostages were brought from Algeria to the base Friday , the official said , and are being flown to their home countries as their conditions warrant . The remains of one American hostage were also brought to the base , the official said . 
In a statement Saturday night , the White House said it was in close contact with Algeria 's government to    gain a fuller understanding of what took place . ' 
British Foreign Secretary William Hague echoed those remarks , adding his government is    working hard to get definitive information ' about each individual . 
Japan has 10 citizens -- likely affiliated with JGC Corp. , an engineering firm that was involved in gas production in In Amenas -- who are yet to be confirmed safe , in addition to a number of dead .

Such Islamist militant activity is not new to Africa , including recent violence in Mali and Somalia . 
Algeria 's status as Africa 's largest natural gas producer and a major supplier of the product to Europe heightens its importance to those who want to invest there . Yet that interest is coupled with pressure to make sure foreign nationals , and their business ventures , are safe . 
Youcef Yousfi , Algeria 's energy and mining minister , insisted Sunday his country can keep its gas facilities secure and ruled out foreign forces coming in to help . 
   We are going to strengthen security , and we rely first on our means and resources , ' Yousfi said , according to the official Algerian Press Service . 
Raids turn deadly 
Militants in pickup trucks struck the sprawling gas complex about 50 kilometers -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of the Libyan border at dawn Wednesday , gathered the Westerners who worked there into a group and tied them up . 
The In Amenas plant is run by Algeria 's state oil company , in cooperation with foreign firms such as Statoil and BP , and because of that employed workers from several countries . 
The kidnappers wielded AK-47 rifles and put explosive-laden vests on some hostages , according to a U.S. State Department official . 
Algeria said the attack was in retaliation for allowing France to use Algerian airspace for an offensive against Islamist militants in neighboring Mali . 
And Sahara News  report Sunday claimed Belmoktar said    40 immigrant Jihadists and supporters of Muslim countries ' led the siege in retaliation for the Mali offensive .

But regional analysts believe it was too sophisticated to have been planned in just days . 
On Thursday , Algerian special forces moved in because the government said the militants wanted to flee to Mali . 
The Islamic extremists also planned to blow up the gas installation and rigged it with mines throughout , the U.S. official said . 
Thursday 's military incursion succeeded in freeing some hostages -- but not all . 
Some survivors described their harrowing escapes by rigging up disguises and sneaking to safety with locals , with at least one survivor running for his life with plastic explosives strapped around his neck . 
Several hostages died . And the Algerian military came under criticism from some quarters for unnecessarily endangering hostages  lives . 
Undeterred , the government followed with a second push Saturday . That assault killed the remaining hostage-takers but resulted in more hostage deaths . 
The army intervened    to avoid a bloody turning point of events in this extremely dangerous situation , ' the Algerian Interior Ministry said Saturday . 
   It was clear that the terrorists were determined to escape the country with the captives and to bomb the gas installations . ' 
On Sunday , an American lawmaker said the Algerian government turned down U.S. offers to help during the crisis . 
   They decided they were going to handle it their way , ' said Rep. Mike Rogers , a Michigan Republican who is chairman of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee .    They did not want us or the other hostage nations involved in the decision-making . ' 
British Defense Secretary Philip Hammond called the loss of life    appalling and unacceptable , ' while laying blame solely on the terrorists . 
Countries mourn dead , try to track down missing 
While the military part of the operation is over , the searching and mourning is not for people in countries worldwide . In addition to combing the sprawling desert site , Algerian forces are searching hospitals and medical centers around the country , as well as towns and villages near the targeted site , according to a statement Sunday from Statoil .
