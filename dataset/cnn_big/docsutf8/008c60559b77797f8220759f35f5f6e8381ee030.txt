WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Republican presidential front-runner Sen. John McCain on Thursday defended his statement that U.S. troops could spend    maybe 100 ' years in Iraq -- saying he was referring to a military presence similar to what the nation already has in places like Japan , Germany and South Korea . 
Sen. John McCain defends his stance on troops in Iraq Thursday on CNN 's    Larry King Live . ' 
This week , Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama both took McCain to task for the comments , saying that if he 's elected he would continue what they call President Bush 's failed policies in Iraq . 
   It 's not a matter of how long we 're in Iraq , it 's if we succeed or not , ' McCain said to CNN 's Larry King . 
   And both Sen. Obama and Clinton want to set a date for withdrawal -- that means chaos , that means genocide , that means undoing all the success we 've achieved and al Qaeda tells the world they defeated the United States of America . 
   I wo n't let that happen . ' 
Last month , at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire , a crowd member asked McCain about a Bush statement that troops could stay in Iraq for 50 years . 
   Maybe 100 , ' McCain replied .    As long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed , it 's fine with me and I hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al Qaeda is training , recruiting , equipping and motivating people every single day . ' 
The remaining Democratic contenders for the White House seized on the statement . Watch McCain talk about Mitt Romney 's endorsement and his critics on the right ' 
   He said recently he could see having troops in Iraq for 100 years , ' Clinton said at an Arlington , Virginia , rally last week in a line she 's repeated on the campaign trail .    Well , I want them home within 60 days of my becoming president of the United States . ' 
Obama took a similar tack . 
   Sen. McCain said the other day that we might be mired for 100 years in Iraq -- which is reason enough not to give him four years in the White House , ' Obama has said on several occasions . 
McCain told King he thinks opponents are taking the quote out of context . He said any long-term troop presence in Iraq would depend on agreement from the Iraqi government . 
   If they do n't want to and we do n't feel a need to do so , obviously , the whole thing is keyed to Americans being able to withdraw and come home with honor , not in defeat , ' he said . 
McCain was endorsed Thursday by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , once considered his fiercest rival for the GOP nomination . 
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee remains in the race , although McCain has an overwhelming advantage in the number of delegates earned for this year 's Republican convention . E-mail to a friend
