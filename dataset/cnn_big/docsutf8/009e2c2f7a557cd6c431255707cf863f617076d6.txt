-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Long before fish swam in Macquariums , hipsters got Apple logo tattoos and thousands camped out for days to get into computer store openings , there was a machine . 
Danielle Brecker found this 1989 photo of friends on their Macs at Drexel University in Philadelphia . 
Saturday marks the 25th anniversary of the original Macintosh , the first personal computer to draw masses , introduce the mouse and incorporate a graphical user interface , relying on images instead of text . 
The Apple Inc. watershed product entered American consciousness amid fanfare , with a $ 1.5 million commercial , made by Ridley Scott , wowing audiences during Super Bowl XVIII . The piece 's title ,    1984 , ' invoked author George Orwell 's message and stood as a warning against conformity . 
Two days after the ad ran , the Macintosh became available and life , as people knew it , changed . No longer were computers viewed as toys with which to play primitive games or as untouchable tools reserved for degreed engineers . We began to think different . 
   The Macintosh demonstrated that it was possible and profitable to create a machine to be used by millions and millions of people , ' said Alex Soojung-Kim Pang , research director for the Institute for the Future , a Palo Alto , California , think tank , and chief force behind    Making the Macintosh : Technology and Culture in Silicon Valley , ' an online historical exhibit .    The gold standard now for personal electronics is ,   Is it easy enough for my grandmother to use it ?  People on the Macintosh project were the first people to talk about a product in that way . ' 
Pang , 44 , remembered being    mesmerized ' by the computer when he first saw it up close in his college bookstore . He was n't alone . Read about how iReporters are preserving Mac history 
For graphic designers like ZoÃ« Korstvedt , now a Los Angeles creative director , the evolving Mac , with each added feature , was ripe with ah-ha moments . 
To tinker with a piece , play with the text ,    to visualize on your computer was just insane , ' she said .    My colleagues and I wonder how we did it -LSB- their jobs -RSB- before . ' 
No wonder , then , that when Korstvedt , 44 , married her first husband in 1989 , she used half of their wedding money to buy her first home computer : a Mac SE/30 , for which she forked over extra bucks for an upgrade to a whopping 8 megabytes of RAM . Nothing compared to the 12 gigs she now has .    I was styling , ' she said with a laugh . 
Jeremy Mehrle , 30 , of the St. Louis , Missouri , area is too young to know a world without Macs . This MacAddict began hoarding and tinkering with tossed-out computers , and then he discovered eBay . Today , the motion graphics designer 's 1,400 square-foot basement is a museum to Apple computers , all-white and in gallery-style with about 80 fully-functioning machines on display . 
   Some people think it 's really cool . ... Others say   It 's Jeremy 's thing , it 's a little weird , whatever ,  ' he said .    I think if I had stacks everywhere , and you could n't move in my house , people would be worried . ' 
What 's Mehrle 's hobby , however , became a career for Dan Foust , 38 , of Bloomington , Illinois .    Danapplemacman , ' as he 's known on eBay , makes a living out of buying , and when necessary resuscitating , these computers before hawking them online to customers/collectors in places as far-flung as Italy and Australia . 
So what would people pay for an original Macintosh ? 
   A complete boxed system ? , ' he said .    I ca n't put a price on that . ' 
The extremes to which people have gone in their love and loyalty for Apple -LRB- and specifically Macs -RRB- knows no bounds . Perhaps no one knows this better than Leander Kahney , news editor at Wired.com and author of Cult of Mac , as well as the more recently published Inside Steve 's Brain . That would be Apple co-founder Steve Jobs  brain , of course . 
From his phone in a San Francisco coffee shop , Kahney told tales of people allotting their limited vacation time to Macworld conferences , a man who has traveled to 40 Apple store openings and those who shaved Apple logos into their heads . As for the Apple tattoos , those , at first , really bothered him . 
   I 'm a bit of a leftie , ' he said . The idea of    corporate worship ' did n't initially sit well with him -- although he 's not afraid to admit his own obsession .    It 's a very deep relationship people have with their computers . ... If the computer 's not working , it 's more important than the car breaking down . ' 
Speaking of worship , Israeli filmmakers Ron and Kobi Shely created    MacHEADS : The Movie , ' a 50-minute documentary that 'll be available next week on Amazon 's video on demand service and , soon after , on iTunes . The film includes footage from The Church of Mac in Los Angeles , where a preacher and congregants gathered to glorify the computer at a service that ended with ,    Praise Steve . ' 
   Although we read a lot about the -LSB- Mac -RSB- phenomenon , ' Ron Shely said by phone from Tel Aviv of the two-year film project ,    we did n't realize how big this social movement really is . ' 
And that , beyond the products , is what has been so powerful about the Mac brand , said Peter Friess , president of The Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose , California . iReport.com : Got your own Mac Museum ? Show us ! 
Steve Jobs    really has changed the world , ' Friess said .    You hardly find people who changed cultures . He changed culture . ' 
Decades before Jobs  health became a topic of discussion , Friess was lucky enough to meet the man . At the time , German-born Friess was a lowly watchmaker , repairing clocks in the basement of Munich 's Deutsches Museum , the largest science and technology museum in the world . 
The year was 1984 , and Friess thought a Macintosh might come in handy , so he called Apple Germany to see if he might be able to get one . The answer , as he recalled it , '   You 're very lucky . Steve Jobs is in town . We 'll come over and give you one .  ' 
Ever since , he 's been amazed and exceedingly intrigued by every new computer .    My wife goes crazy , ' Friess , 49 , admitted .    Every Apple computer I buy , the first thing I do is take it apart , just to see what 's inside . ' 
For Gary Allen , 61 , of Berkeley , California , his interest is less inside than it is outside the company 's stores . He runs ifoAppleStore.com , the first three letters taken from his police dispatch days , meaning    in front of . ' 
The site 's genesis dates back to 2001 when Apple store No. 9 opened , in Palo Alto , and he and his son went early . Way early -- as in the night before . The crowds , and natural community , grew on Allen , who began seeing new-found friends at other openings . They were like groupies chasing a band . 
So he started a Web site , to help fans keep in touch , and soon other Apple enthusiasts began writing from across the globe , sharing tips about new stores , as well as testimonies and photos . The site , he said , averages about 4 million visitors a month . 
Allen , who guessed he 's been to 22 store openings so far , once stood in the rain for days in Tokyo so he could snag the first spot in line . He 's seen old friends at openings in Germany and Italy . Last summer , he and his now 21-year-old son experienced what he called    the perfect storm , ' hitting Boston , Beijing and Sydney . Next stop : Paris . 
He may not speak the same language as the thousands who surround him in these various cities , but that does n't much matter when people speak the same language of computer love . 
   Apple enthusiasts , it turns out , ' Allen said ,    are the same wherever you go . '
