-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One of the most highly anticipated apps for Apple devices was made available on Wednesday . At least , until it was n't . 
Google announced a Gmail app for the iPhone , iPad and iPod Touch that was designed to make it easier for the service 's more than 190 million users to navigate their mail . 
   We check email pretty much everywhere these days , ' Google content manager Matthew Izatt wrote on the Gmail blog .    And when we do , we want easy access to our important messages so we can respond quickly and get back to life -- or slinging birds at thieving green pigs . ' 
Users of Apple 's operating system could already access Gmail through a mobile site or set it up as their default e-mail account . But the new app promised a smoother experience with a host of new features . The tech blogosphere was delighted . 
   Go get the iPhone app for Gmail ! ' popular blogger Robert Scoble wrote on his Google + page . 
Then , a few minutes passed . 
   UPDATE : DO NOT . The Gmail app is really a piece of crud , ' he wrote .    Not worth loading . Very disappointed . ' 
Google had obviously already noticed what Scoble did . Shortly after it was unveiled , the app was pulled from the Apple Store . 
   The iOS app we launched today contained a bug with notifications , ' Google posted on its Gmail Twitter account .    We have pulled the app to fix the problem . Sorry we messed up . ' 
Later , a fuller explanation was added to the original blog post . 
   Earlier today we launched a new Gmail app for iOS , ' Google posted .    Unfortunately , it contained a bug which broke notifications and caused users to see an error message when first opening the app . We 've removed the app while we correct the problem , and we 're working to bring you a new version soon . Everyone who 's already installed the app can continue to use it . ' 
The app ... at least the fully working version of it ... will send push notifications and sound cues when new messages are received , search your inbox for an e-mail , autocomplete e-mail addresses and upload photos to messages . 
It will also feature the same Priority Inbox that Gmail 's Web version has and add a new mobile interface that will allow users to navigate their inbox more quickly with touch controls . 
There was no word from Google Wednesday afternoon as to when the fixed app might be back up .
