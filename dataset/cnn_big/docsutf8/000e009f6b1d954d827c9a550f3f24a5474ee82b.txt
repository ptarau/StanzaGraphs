-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Kyle White now has two pieces of metal to wear -- one , a bracelet inscribed with the names of his six comrades killed in an ambush in Afghanistan , the other , a Medal of Honor given to him for his valor that ensured that death toll was n't higher . 
Speaking minutes after President Barack Obama gave him the highest military honor , White insisted the two emblems are equally significant . They both represent his family on that day six years ago -- the seven others who , like him , survived as well as those who did not . 
The former Army sergeant said Tuesday he owes it to these men , whom he calls    my heroes , ' to live his life well , even now that he 's left the military , and with honor . 
   Though I am still uncomfortable with hearing my name and the word   hero  in the same sentence , I am now ready for the challenge of proudly wearing this piece of blue fabric and carved metal with the same reverence that I wear the bracelet . And I vow to live up to the responsibility of doing so , ' White said . 
Not long before , Obama recalled White 's bravery and that of his colleagues . 
The President paid tribute to those who died that fall day in Afghanistan and those who survived . They had done everything their country could ask for and more . 
   Kyle , members of Chosen Company , you did your duty , ' Obama said .    And now it 's time for America to do ours . ' 
White himself insisted that the Medal of Honor can not really be an individual award , calling it    a testament to the trust we have in each other and our leaders . ' 
Still , the President said that he deserved to be singled out . A high school freshman when the Twin Towers fell on September 11 , 2001 , White joined the Army and was just 20 years old and 21 months into his military service when he faced the ultimate test . 
He aced it , and in doing so represented the best of what Obama called the    9/11 generation -LRB- which -RRB- has proven itself to be one of America 's greatest . ' 
   Today , ' the President said to a crowd that included White , his parents and many of his former comrades ,    we pay tribute to a soldier who embodies the courage of his generation . ' 
Attacked in   ambush alley  
On Tuesday , White dressed in full uniform . But on most other weekdays , he now wears a suit to his job as an investment analyst at a bank in Charlotte , North Carolina -- a job that he 's admitted to Obama , with a laugh , is less exciting than his previous job in the Army . 
The Washington state native joined up after high school , following the lead of his father , a former Army Special Forces member . His service had , like many other members of the military , earned him a ticket to Afghanistan as his platoon 's radio telephone operator . 
He was there on November 9 , 2007 , walking back from a meeting with elders with his unit of 14 and a squad of Afghan army soldiers . 
   They knew not to stop , they had to keep moving , ' Obama recalled of the group walking single-file with a cliff to their right and a steep , rocky slope to their left .    They were heading into an area known as ambush alley . ' 
In an interview prior to the award ceremony , White told CNN how the group walked    down this little incline and looking into the valley , -LRB- when -RRB- I hear this single shot . Then two shots , then the echo , then fully automatic gunfire . ' 
Taking so much fire , members of his patrol were separated as they tried to take cover . White was finishing off his first magazine and beginning to load another one when an rocket-propelled grenade exploded , knocking him unconscious . 
Moments after he came to , an enemy round hit a rock just inches from his head . The shrapnel and rock fragments cut his face . 
Dazed , he struggled to take in what was happening . He and four others had been separated from the other soldiers , who 'd jumped from a cliff . White administered first aid to one wounded soldier using the only cover available : a single tree . That soldier would survive . 
It was at that point in the attack that White realized his radio was n't working . 
He looked out and saw a member of his patrol about 30 feet away whose wounds were so bad that he could not move . White ran toward him , braving enemy fire . 
White was able to drag the wounded man back to the tree . 
But the man 's injuries were too severe , and he died . 
Risking death , again and again 
White continued to risk himself to help his fellow warriors , again running from cover into enemy fire to reach the platoon leader . White told the military publication Stars and Stripes that he could see the leader 's helmet and assault pack , but he could n't tell whether the leader was alive . White had to see , he said . 
White crawled toward the man . It was too late . He was dead . 
White figured he would be killed . But he would do what he was trained to do . He would carry out his duty . 
   It was never a choice , ' he explained to CNN .    I told myself from the beginning that I was going to be killed , you know ... just the amount of fire ... I 'm not gon na make it through this . ' 
But he kept focused . The soldier White had dragged to the tree earlier was hit again , this time in the knee , so the White wrapped his belt around the man 's leg , creating a tourniquet . 
Then White found a working radio on a deceased comrade and called for artillery and helicopter gunships to help . 
Finally , maybe , there could be hope . But then a friendly mortar round landed near White . 
   I remember just red hot chunks of metal like the size of my palm just flinging by your head , ' he told Stars and Stripes . 
Suffering a concussion , White managed to hang on , waiting for helicopters to evacuate him and others with him that day . When help arrived , he told his rescuers to put the other wounded aboard first . 
A soldier , changed 
Speaking with National Public Radio this week , White said the experience -- from the violence to the wait -- seemed like    forever . ' And it has n't entirely gone away , all these years later . 
   It 's something you still think about every day , ' White said .    I still have these images from that day burned into my head . But it 's something , as time goes on , it gets easier . ' 
But something inside him changed , he said . 
   Even to this day , you know , I ca n't say if it was something good or bad . ... ' he told NPR .    And that was pretty much the reason why I decided to leave the Army . ' 
White first returned home and trained other paratrooopers . When it came time for White to re-enlist , he thought hard about whether doing so felt right . He decided against it because he doubted that he could devote his complete heart and mind to it , he told NPR . 
It was unacceptable to him to continue in the service and then , perhaps , be deployed to Afghanistan . Service members deserve a leader who is all in , he explained . 
Obama called him on February 10 to tell him he 'd be given the Medal of Honor . He 's the 10th recipient of that award for his actions in Afghanistan , and the seventh surviving recipient . Four service members received the Medal of Honor -- all posthumously -- for actions in the war in Iraq , according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society . 
In a brief statement to reporters after Tuesday 's ceremony , White called the Medal of Honor    a symbol of the responsibility all soldiers knowingly face when they depart for distant lands in defense of the nation , a responsibility that locks us all in the bonds of brotherhood . ' 
As such , White could n't help but think about his brothers in arms . 
   Without the team , ' he said ,    there could be no Medal of Honor . That is why I wear this medal for my team . '
