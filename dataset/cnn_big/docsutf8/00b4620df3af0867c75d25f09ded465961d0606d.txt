-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Federal civil rights investigators have found    reasonable cause ' to believe that police in Portland , Oregon , use    unnecessary or unreasonable force ' with persons who have mental illness , the U.S. Justice Department said . 
The department 's civil rights division and U.S. Attorney 's Office in Oregon issued a letter to Portland Mayor Sam Adams stating that local and federal authorities will    continue our collaborative relationship to craft sustainable remedies . ' 
In the 42-page letter , federal officials outline remedies that include training and new policies to investigate alleged police misconduct . 
Investigators found cause to believe that the Portland Police Bureau engages in    a pattern or practice of using excessive force in encounters involving people with actual or perceived mental illness . ' 
   We found instances that support a pattern of dangerous uses of force against persons who posed little or no threat and who could not , as a result of their mental illness , comply with officers  commands , ' said the letter , which was signed by Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez and U.S. Attorney Amanda Marshall . 
   We also found that PPB employs practices that escalate the use of force where there were clear earlier junctures when the force could have been avoided or minimized . ' 
One incident in December 2010 involved several officers who used    repeated closed-fist punches and repeated shocking of a subject who was to be placed on a mental health hold , ' the letter said . 
Adams , in a posting on his web page , vowed that the city and its Police Bureau would improve quickly , and listed a series of changes : 
-- The city will revise its use-of-force policies -- particularly those regarding the use of stun guns --    to ensure that officers have necessary guidance when encountering someone with mental illness or perceived to have mental illness . ' 
-- The police will expand their Mobile Crisis Unit -- composed of an officer and a mental health worker --    to ensure availability at all times and enhance non-law enforcement capacity to respond to persons in crisis that do not pose a public safety threat . ' 
-- The city will establish a mental health desk at its 911 calling center to ensure calls are properly dispatched . 
-- The city will lead efforts to boost community mental health treatment options , such as establishing a 24-hour secure drop-off and walk-in center ,    that will provide police officers more options when assisting persons experiencing a mental health crisis . ' 
-- The city will use an early intervention system to identify officers , supervisors and units    for non-punitive corrective action , and to assess gaps in policy , training , supervision and accountability . ' 
-- The city will move to speed investigations of complaints about possible officer misconduct . 
-- A community body composed of representatives of a variety of groups will assess how well the agreement is being implemented , offer recommendations on additional steps , and advise the police chief and Adams on how to improve community relations .
