Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Chris Brown sat alone in court for 35 minutes on Friday while his lawyer talked with the judge and prosecutor behind closed doors in his probation violation case . 
The judge emerged from his chambers to order Brown to come back on June 10 because lawyers need more time to look at    additional discovery ' in his case . 
While not much happened in Friday 's hearing before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin , ultimately it could be big trouble for the singer . 
In a court filing in February , prosecutors accused Brown of not completing the 180 days of community labor ordered when he pleaded guilty to a felony assault charge in the beating of his girlfriend Rihanna .

The paperwork Brown submitted to show he had completed community labor is    at best sloppy documentation and at worst fraudulent reporting , ' District Attorney Jackie Lacey said . Brown was n't in town on some of the dates reported , the motion said . 
Mark Geragos , Brown 's attorney , said after the last hearing that the prosecutor 's filing was so fraudulent that he would ask the judge to punish the deputy district attorneys involved and call for a contempt of court hearing for filing false documents with the court . 
   And I do n't mean just false , it is fraudulent , ' Geragos said . 
The Los Angeles County district attorney 's office has    tortured ' Brown during his probation more than any client he 's ever had , Geragos said . 
Despite the serious allegations outlined in the court filing , the prosecutor is not asking for Brown 's probation to be revoked and the singer sent to jail . She is asking the judge to order him to restart his 1,400 hours of community service under the supervision of a Los Angeles probation officer . 
Brown and his mother were in court for Friday 's hearing , but Rihanna , who attended his last court date , was not there . 
When the pop star sat behind Brown in court at that hearing , it was Rihanna 's second time in a courtroom with him . The first was the day in August 2009 when Brown was sentenced to five years  probation and ordered to stay away from her . Then , she was a witness for the prosecution . 
At the probation court date , when Geragos was asked why Brown 's assault victim was in court , he replied ,    She thinks it 's utterly ridiculous what they 're doing to him . '
