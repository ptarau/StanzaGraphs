Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Los Angeles Clippers co-owner Shelly Sterling asked a Los Angeles probate court Wednesday to uphold her negotiated sale of the team for $ 2 billion despite her husband 's objections , her attorney said . 
The probate court agreed to hold a four-day trial on the issue , beginning July 7 . 
Sterling 's legal maneuver comes as three physicians say her estranged husband , Donald , 80 , is mentally incapacitated , said her attorney , Pierce O'Donnell . Court papers say her husband shows early Alzheimer 's or other brain disease . 
Donald Sterling , the team 's other co-owner , does n't want to sell the team as the National Basketball Association demands ; this week he called the league    despicable monsters ' and    a band of hypocrites and bullies . ' 
O'Donnell said his client sought an expedited hearing    given the fact this is a very important transaction , ' he said . 
   It 's unfortunate . Mrs. Sterling regrets having to go to court and publicly air this problem . But Mr. Sterling 's conduct in reneging on the sale requires her to do so , ' O'Donnell said . 
Joining Sterling and O'Donnell at the courthouse Wednesday was the attorney for former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer , with whom Shelly Sterling has reached an agreement to sell the franchise for a record $ 2 billion . 
Donald Sterling opposes a sale of the team and says he gave his wife a purported letter only to negotiate with a buyer , not to formally sell the team , his attorney said Wednesday . 
   Bottom line , Donald Sterling does not want to sell the team , ' attorney Bobby Samini said . 
Technically , a family trust owns the Clippers . But O'Donnell said that three physicians have certified that Donald Sterling lacks the mental capacity to function as a trustee of the complex trust . 
   The trust agreement provides that if two qualified physicians certify that he 's mentally incapacitated , he 's removed . We also have a third distinguished doctor who 's an expert in this field , mental capacity , who has reviewed the evidence , and supports the other doctors and agrees on that conclusion . So there 's three doctors . We only need two , ' O'Donnell said . 
   This is a complex business . You have a $ 2 billion basketball team . You have massive amount of 150 real estate holdings , and it requires a person to run the business who is competent , and the doctor -- three doctors -- have said that he lacks the mental capacity , ' O'Donnell said . 
Doctors  findings 
Donald Sterling recently underwent a CT scan and a PET scan of his brain , according to Shelly Sterling 's court filings . 
Dr. Meril S. Platzer , a California neurologist , examined Donald Sterling on May 19 and found he    is suffering from cognitive impairment secondary to primary dementia Alzheimer 's disease , ' court papers said . 
The PET scan on May 16 providing findings    consistent with a neurodementia of the Alzheimer 's type , ' Platzer said in his certification of Donald Sterling 's incapacity . 
Donald Sterling was unable to spell    world ' backward , was unaware of the season of the year and initially had difficulty drawing a clock , Platzer said in court papers . 
Dr. James Edward Spar , a specialist in geriatric psychiatry who examined Donald Sterling on May 22 , said Sterling suffers    mild global cognitive impairment ' and    the overall picture is consistent with early Alzheimer 's disease , but could reflect other forms of brain disease , ' court papers said . 
Platzer said in a May 29 certification that Donald Sterling has    an impairment of his level of attention , information processing , short term memory impairment and ability to modulate mood , emotional liability , and is at risk of making potentially serious errors of judgment , ' court papers said . 
Spar said in May 27 letter that Donald Sterling    is substantially unable to manage his finances and resist fraud and undue influence , and is no longer competent to act as trustee of his trust , ' court documents said . 
Another specialist in geriatric psychiatry , Dr. Stephen L. Read ,    confirmed the methodology and conclusions of Drs. Platzer and Spar , ' court papers said . 
   I agree that the history and the findings are highly suspect as representing the slow emergence of progressive dementia , and specifically Alzheimer 's disease , ' Read said in documents filed in court .    In addition , the findings described are fully consistent with the general loss of brain tissue and , more specifically , with the pattern of impaired brain functions demonstrated by the PET scan of May 16 , 2014 . ' 
Under the trust agreement , if Donald Sterling became mentally incapacitated , he would be removed as a trustee , O'Donnell said . 
Donald Sterling is mentally sound , one of his lawyers , Maxwell Blecher , told CNN on Tuesday . 
   It strikes me as totally incredible to argue that this man -- I talk to him every day -- is incapable of making decisions and is mentally incompetent , ' Blecher said on Tuesday afternoon .    And I do n't believe any court is going to make a finding to the contrary . ' 
Adam Streisand , the attorney for Ballmer , said his client was hoping for a speedy court date . 
   Mr. Ballmer has insisted , as a provision of this deal , Shelly Sterling get approval from the court that she has the authority as the sole trustee based upon the removal of Mr. Sterling as a trustee . So we are here because Mr. Ballmer is insisting that the court bless the transaction , ' Streisand said . 
   If it does not go forward , the consequences are dire , ' Streisand said .    Mr. Ballmer is not going to stick around for years , for this to wind through the courts . And the NBA has made it very clear that it will take over the team , and that is a consequence that is not going to benefit the Sterling family . ' 
September deadline 
Donald Sterling initially vowed to fight the sale and filed a lawsuit against the NBA , then said he was going along with the sale -- until Monday , when he again pulled his support .    From the onset , I did not want to sell the Los Angeles Clippers . I have worked for 33 years to build the team , ' Donald Sterling said . 
In Shelly Sterling 's court filings , NBA general counsel Richard W. Buchanan said if the Sterlings do n't sell the team by September 15 , the league may sell the team or renew termination proceedings against the Clippers or both . 
In one document , Shelly Sterling said her husband    has gone back and forth between opposing the sale and supporting the sale ' of the team since May 29 . 
   To date , I have not received Donald 's written consent to the sale of the Clippers to -LRB- Ballmer -RRB- for $ 2 billion , ' Shelly Sterling said in court papers . 
Sterling has been embroiled in controversy since a recording of a conversation with his friend V. Stiviano surfaced . The recording included a series of racist comments . 
Sterling 's comments , first posted on TMZ , sparked outrage among NBA players , executives and fans . The commissioner fined Sterling $ 2.5 million and banned him for life from the NBA . 
In a statement Tuesday , Sterling said he has apologized for the remarks and his apology is sincere . 
He also made inflammatory comments to CNN 's    Anderson Cooper 360 ' about African-Americans , which the NBA had planned to use as part of its evidence against him in an owners  meeting where a vote would be taken on whether to terminate his ownership rights . The meeting was canceled . 
Sterling 's lawsuit makes clear that he believes the NBA has no right to force such a sale , and the league was wrong in banning him for life and fining him . 
In addition to damages , the lawsuit seeks a restraining order . 
Sterling says NBA officials are   bullies ,    hypocrites ,    monsters
