Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In one ill-fated fundraiser , Mitt Romney managed to offend Palestinians , Latinos and some of the same people he 's counting on for support if he wants to unseat President Barack Obama . 
It is n't the first time Romney 's oratory fumbles have put his campaign on its heels , handed opponents material to push the stereotype of him as an out-of-touch businessman and provoked members of the party 's conservative base to question his worthiness as their standard-bearer . 
   Everybody has the same reaction :   dumb , dumb , dumb ,  ' said Larry Sabato , director of the University of Virginia 's Center for Politics , adding that Romney 's gaffes reinforce a sitcom-like caricature of the candidate . 
Opinion : What 's wrong with Romney 
After the tape , recorded during a May 17 private fundraiser at the home of Sun Capital executive Marc Leder , made the rounds on Monday , Romney convened a hastily scheduled news conference Monday night in which he said his comments were    off the cuff ' and    not elegantly stated . ' 
However , he defended the main message of his remarks , saying he that while he could have made them    more clearly , ' he said he was trying to point out the differences between his and Obama 's campaigns . 
Democratic pundits gloated and were content to let Romney 's words speak for themselves . 
   I mean , I do n't think Democrats had much to say at all . I mean , there was n't much left to say , ' Democratic strategist Richard Socarides said on CNN 's    Early Start . '    Look , I mean , I think that , you know , big picture , this is a -- was a devastating moment for Governor Romney , potentially fatal , as people start to focus on this campaign . ' 
Narratives at work 
Another Democratic strategist said that Romney 's comments played into the two narratives that they have pushed :    First , that he does n't care about the middle class . Well , thanks for the help , Mitt , ' Paul Begala , a CNN contributor and a senior adviser in the leading pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA , said on CNN 's    AC360 . ' 
   On the second front ... in order to give big tax cuts for the rich , Mitt Romney is going to have to raise taxes on the middle class . Well , when you 're claiming to wealthy people that 47 percent of Americans do n't pay federal income tax , I think a lot of those people , retirees , working class folks are going to listen to that and think ,   Gee , I guess the Democrats are right . I guess he does want to raise the taxes on the middle class in order to help the rich .  ' 
Republican strategist Margaret Hoover , who served in the Bush White House , said the comments would wound Romney but it would n't be a fatal one . 
Video threatens Romney campaign 
   You can understand while he tripped over his words , it probably was n't characterized the best way . I think we can all agree with that , ' she said on    Early Start . '    You can understand what he was trying to say . Do we have a systemic problem in this country when you have almost 50 percent of people not paying any federal income taxes ? And he 's running on a platform that would fundamentally change the tax code so that you lower the base , broaden the base and lower tax rates across the board . ' 
Reaction from other conservatives was mixed . While some some applauded Romney 's comments , others saw them as reinforcing why they questioned his legitimacy . 
CNN contributor and conservative blogger Erick Erickson tweeted :    Dammit ! I 'm just now seeing these Romney secret videos . We need that guy on the campaign trail ! ' 
Others , such as New York Times columnist , David Brooks , wrote    Romney 's comment is a country-club fantasy . It 's what self-satisfied millionaires say to each other . It reinforces every negative view people have about Romney . ' 
And conservative commentator Bill Kristol , a frequent critic of Romney , called the remarks    stupid and arrogant . ' 
   It 's worth recalling that a good chunk of the 47 percent who do n't pay income taxes are Romney supporters Ã¢ $ ' especially of course seniors -LRB- who might well    believe they are entitled to heath care , ' a position Romney agrees with -RRB- , as well as many lower-income Americans -LRB- including men and women serving in the military -RRB- who think conservative policies are better for the country even if they 're not getting a tax cut under the Romney plan . So Romney seems to have contempt not just for the Democrats who oppose him , but for tens of millions who intend to vote for him , ' Kristol posted on The Weekly Standard on Tuesday . 
Romney campaign responds 
A Romney adviser tried to put the comments in context : 
   What he 's saying is there are people out there who do n't pay taxes , unfortunately , ' Bay Buchanan , a senior adviser , said on CNN 's    Starting Point ' on Tuesday .    They 're in a position where they 're dependent on government , and those individuals are -- those Americans are voting for Barack Obama . They 're in his backyard . And so those are people that I 'm not going to be able to reach with my 20 percent tax cut or my cuts in spending because they would be concerned . It 's not going to impact them getting a 20 percent tax cut . They do n't pay taxes . ' 
Romney 's comments were recorded by a hidden camera and posted Monday afternoon on the left-leaning news websites Mother Jones and The Huffington Post . 
Romney argued nearly half of Americans will vote for Obama because they rely on government support . 
Adding to his argument about entitlement , Romney said his    job is not to worry about those people . ' 
He also joked about wishing he had Latino heritage and talks about a Chinese factory his former firm purchased . 
A clip released Tuesday morning showed Romney questioning the prospect of ever reaching peace between Israelis and Palestinians , calling a path to a solution in the region    almost unthinkable to accomplish . ' 
   I 'm torn by two perspectives in this regard , ' Romney is shown saying in a clip that only shows only the candidate speaking and does not include any questions that may have prompted his remarks .    One is the one which I 've had for some time , which is that the Palestinians have no interest whatsoever in establishing peace , and that the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish . ' 
Opinion : How Romney really feels about the GOP 
With two weeks until the first presidential debate and less than two months before the election , the timing could n't be worse , political experts say . 
The Romney campaign had banked on its convention last month to make a favorable introduction of Romney to the electorate , a large part of it just beginning to pay attention to the election . But a CNN/ORC International poll conducted after the convention showed Romney gained only a 1 % rise in the polls while Obama gained three to four times that much following the Democrats  convention . 
Romney 's acceptance speech was largely overshadowed by a rambling , off-the-cuff monologue by actor Clint Eastwood , which preceded it . 
Last week , Romney was criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike for an aggressive and politically charged response to violent attacks on U.S. embassies in Egypt and Libya . After the attacks , Romney in a statement said ,    It 's disgraceful that the Obama administration 's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions , but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks . ' 
Series of gaffes 
Over the weekend , Politico posted a story that detailed tensions within Romney 's campaign and on Monday the campaign launched a new effort to inject energy and fresh policy details with a series of speeches and advertising . 
   There 's been a bit of bad luck involved in some of it , ' said John Geer , chairman of Vanderbilt University 's political science department .    It 's not a surprise that these blunt remarks are going to be made in front of this type of audience . Here 's a guy who 's trying to work on his image about caring and this does n't help him at all . ' 
Romney has been plagued by a series of gaffes during his presidential run . 
He joked with unemployed workers in Florida in June 2011 that he , too , was also unemployed . 
In January of this year , he told a crowd of supporters that he likes    being able to fire people ' in a talk about insurance companies . He went on to say that if someone did n't provide adequate services , he liked to be able to find someone else who would . But critics took the first part of the quote used it to paint him as a venture capitalist focused only on a company 's bottom line . 
Controversial video shows candid Romney 
In a February interview , Romney told CNN that he is    not concerned about the very poor , ' citing the safety net in place by the American government and said that his primary focus is the middle class . But it was the first part of the sentence that critics pounced on as evidence of Romney 's elitism , while conservatives said the safety net he talked about only encouraged a welfare state . 
Later that month , at a campaign stop at the Daytona 500 NASCAR race , Romney told a reporter that while he might not follow the sport as closely as the most ardent fans ,    I have some great friends who are NASCAR team owners . ' 
And at an event in Detroit , he tried to prove he was behind the American automotive industry by saying that he drove a Ford Mustang and a Chevrolet pickup and that his wife , Ann ,    drives a couple of Cadillacs . ' 
Defenders sought to defuse the controversy by pointing to Obama 's comments during the 2008 Democratic primaries about    bitter ' people who    cling to guns or religion . ' 
But those comments came long before the general election and did little to harm him with voters . 
Romney 's comments will serve as a distraction in coming days but there 's still opportunities for him to get back on track with a weak economy and high jobless rate . 
   He 's a tough campaigner Romney . ... I do n't think one should rule him out , ' Geer said .    The fundamentals are still a problem for Obama . '
