BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Brad Blauser lives in war-torn Baghdad , where he does n't earn a paycheck and is thousands of miles from his family . But he has no intention of leaving anytime soon . 
Since 2005 , Brad Blauser 's Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids program has distributed nearly 650 free wheelchairs . 
For the past four years , the Dallas , Texas , native has been providing hope to hundreds of disabled Iraqi children and their families through the distribution of pediatric wheelchairs . 
   Disabled children -- they 're really the forgotten ones in this war , ' said Blauser , 43 .    They are often not seen in society . ' 
Blauser arrived in Iraq as a civilian contractor in 2004 , but quit that job last year to devote himself full time to his program , without compensation . Vote now for the CNN Hero of the Year 
   There 's no paycheck . It 's not really safe here . But this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity , ' he said . 
An estimated one in seven Iraqi children ages 2 to 14 lives with a disability , according to UNICEF . Illnesses such as Spina bifida , palsy and polio leave them unable to walk . 
Some parents carry their children every day . For these children and their families , limited access to health care has taken a toll . 
   A number of families do n't know what 's wrong with their kid . There 's not a doctor available for help -LSB- and -RSB- there 's no pediatric wheelchair source in this country , ' Blauser said . 
Blauser first learned about this situation in 2005 through Maj. David Brown , a battalion surgeon . His friend shared heartbreaking accounts of helpless children pulling themselves along the ground , or living motionless in back rooms , too big to be moved long distances very often . 
   So I asked him ,   What do you need ?  ' Blauser recalled .    And he surprised me by his answer :  I need children 's wheelchairs .  ' 
Blauser began researching and campaigning for help from friends and family in the United States . In 30 days , 31 pediatric and small adult wheelchairs arrived in Mosul for distribution to children in need . Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids was born . 
   The experience for me in the first distribution was awesome , ' said Blauser .    To see the smile come across their face and -LSB- to -RSB- look over at the mothers and fathers -- they 've definitely been changed . ' 
That 's the case for 3-year-old Ali Khaled Ibrahim and his family . At 8 months old , Ali was struck by a mysterious fever that left him partially paralyzed . He can not speak and experiences increasingly frequent and violent convulsions . 
   Ali 's handicap affected the family a lot , ' said his father . 
His mother said she could n't carry out her daily chores and her    psychological state worsened . ' 
   When I heard the news of the distribution of these advanced wheelchairs , I was very happy deep down , ' she said .    I thought maybe that will ease my work as a mother in the way I deal with my son . ' Watch Ali and other children receive their wheelchairs from Blauser 's group ' 
Today , Ali smiles at home as he sits in his new wheelchair . His siblings giggle and sprinkle his face with kisses . The toddler 's parents are thankful for the relief it has brought not only to Ali , but their entire family . 
The boy is among hundreds of disabled Iraqi children to benefit from Blauser 's generosity . Since 2005 , Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids has distributed nearly 650 pediatric wheelchairs . 
To obtain the specialized chairs , Blauser partnered with Reach Out and Care Wheels , a nonprofit pediatric wheelchair organization in Montana . The organization provides wheelchairs designed for rough terrains in developing nations , making the devices    perfect for this environment , ' said Blauser . 
Through sponsor donations , his group purchases the chairs from ROC Wheels for about $ 200 apiece , and USAID donates shipping . Members of the the U.S. and Iraqi armies , Iraqi police and border patrol work together to carry out the distributions . 
Blauser and his group help adjust the children into their wheelchairs , which fit their bodies as they grow . Watch Blauser demonstrate the specialized wheelchair ' 
For Blauser , who provides part-time safety consulting in exchange for room and board , an initial plan to stay for one year has become a dream to get wheelchairs to every Iraqi child who wants one . And he 's determined to see it through . 
   By providing what they need , I 'm hoping to start a movement to change the way people think about disabled children , ' said Blauser .    They are not a curse , they are a blessing and they deserve to have their needs met . '
