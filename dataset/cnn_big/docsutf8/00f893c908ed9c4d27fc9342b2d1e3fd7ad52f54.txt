Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic once again faces two genocide charges instead of one in his long-running trial over ethnic violence during the 1990s Balkan wars . 
Appellate judges at a U.N. war crimes tribunal in the Netherlands on Thursday reinstated the second genocide charge , ruling that the tribunal improperly dismissed the count in June 2012 . 
Karadzic , whose trial began in 2010 , also faces nine other charges related to ethnic violence during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s . 
The reinstated charge accuses Karadzic of trying to permanently remove Bosnian Muslims and Croats from parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992 . The charge was thrown out last year after the prosecution rested its case , with the tribunal ruling that there was n't enough evidence for a genocide conviction on that particular allegation . 
But the appellate judges Thursday ruled that the evidence of serious abuse against Bosnian Muslims and Croats -- including detaining them in overcrowded , squalid conditions where they were starved and left vulnerable to disease -- could be shown to be genocidal acts . 
The judges cited allegations that Karadzic and officials loyal to him decided on a plan to rid Bosnia of Muslims , in part by killing a third of them and converting another third to Orthodox Christianity . 
Thursday 's decision came exactly 18 years after the notorious 1995 Srebrencia massacre , for which Karadzic faces the other genocide charge . 
Nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in July 1995 . Srebrenica became an emblem for the dissolution of Yugoslavia -- once a multiethnic state of Serbs , Croats , Muslims and others -- into six countries during a bloody and brutal conflict . 
On Thursday , more than 400 victims of the massacre were to be reburied at a memorial center in Potocari in Bosnia and Herzegovina , adding to the more than 5,000 victims already buried there , the country 's state-run news agency FENA reported . 
Victims of the massacre have been buried at the site periodically as officials locate and identify more victims in mass graves . 
   Sadness and pain , I have no words . It is so hard , ' said Fadila Efendic , who was set to bury her son Fejzo at the site Thursday , according to FENA .    This is beyond any human comprehension what they did to us and what we are experiencing . ' 
The 1992-95 Bosnian conflict was the longest of the wars spawned by the breakup of Yugoslavia . Karadzic was removed from power in 1995 , when the Dayton Accord that ended the Bosnian war barred anyone accused of war crimes from holding office . 
Karadzic was captured in 2008 after more than 13 years of hiding in plain sight in Belgrade . He had adopted an elaborate disguise that included long hair and a full beard , and was practicing alternative medicine in the Serbian capital . 
His former military commander , Ratko Mladic , was captured in 2011 and is also on trial for charges including genocide . 
Both men would face life in prison if convicted . The court can not impose the death penalty . 
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic also faced charges connected with the Balkan wars , but he died in 2006 while on trial at The Hague .
