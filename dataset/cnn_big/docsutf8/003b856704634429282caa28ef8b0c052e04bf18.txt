-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Timothy Bradley says he needs to beat Manny Pacquiao for a second time in Las Vegas on Saturday to move on from the controversial conclusion of their first fight two years ago . 
The WBO welterweight champion won a contentious points decision when the pair met in June 2012 , inflicting a first defeat on Pacquiao in seven years . 
Boxing commentators roundly criticized the result while former heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis said the scoring showed that boxing had lost its integrity . 
Bradley claims he subsequently received death threats and that he was unfairly targeted by fans and the media alike for the decision of the ringside judges . 
   It would mean the world to me to get this victory for me and my family because of everything we went through in the past , ' the 30-year old told CNN 's Don Riddell . 
   It was like I stole something from the world that night . All I did was do my job . People ridiculed me , demonized me . ' 
Bradley insists these dark experiences made him stronger as a person and will act as the perfect motivation ahead of the MGM Grand rematch . 
He questioned Pacquiao 's hunger at the pre-fight press conference Thursday , suggesting the legendary Filipino 's best days are behind him . 
Pacquiao has won world titles at seven weight divisions in a career stretching 18 years but has lost two of his last three fights . 
   What really motivates me for this fight is what my opponent said , ' Pacquiao countered in riposte to Bradley 's claims . 
   He said I do n't have the killer instinct any more , I do n't have the aggressiveness any more . This helps me , it helps a lot . ' 
Although he recorded a comfortable victory over Brandon Rios last November , Pacquiao was knocked out for the first time since 1999 by Juan Manuel Marquez in his previous bout . 
At 35 , it would be difficult for Pacquiao to resurrect his career at the very highest level if defeated by Bradley for a second time but he refuses to entertain this notion ahead of the contest . 
   My mind is set in the winners side not on the losers side , ' he said .    I always think positive and not negative . ' 
   This fight on Saturday will be to prove that my journey in boxing will continue and I 'm excited for that . '
