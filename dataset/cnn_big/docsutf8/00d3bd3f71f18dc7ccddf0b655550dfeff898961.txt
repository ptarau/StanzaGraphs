-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- All five remaining inmates held in the Mississippi pardons controversy have now been released from prison . 
Mississippi 's Supreme Court last week upheld the controversial pardons of more than 200 convicts that former Gov. Haley Barbour granted on his way out of office , rejecting a challenge by the state 's attorney general . 
In a 77-page , 6-3 ruling Thursday afternoon , the court found the pardons    may not be set aside or voided by the judicial branch . ' 
Attorney General Jim Hood argued that no proper notice had been posted in newspapers , but the court found the final decision rested    solely with the governor . ' 
   We are mindful that the victims and their families are entitled to be interested in the subject matter of this case , and they are undoubtedly -- and understandably -- concerned with its outcome , ' Justice Jess Dickinson wrote for the majority . 
But in the cases before them , it was up to the governor to ' decide whether the Constitution 's publication requirement was met . ' 
In a statement after the court ruling , Barbour said it    reaffirmed more than a century of settled law in our state , ' but acknowledged that his decision has been difficult for many of the inmates  victims . 
But in a dissenting opinion , Justice Michael Randolph called the decision    a stunning victory for some lawless convicted felons , and an immeasurable loss for the law-abiding citizens of our state . ' 
Hood argued that the state Constitution required that for a pardon to be valid , notices be filed , each day , for 30 days in newspapers where their crimes were committed . 
But during a February Supreme Court hearing , Barbour 's lawyers argued that previous state court rulings had found the 30-day notice rule was    an unconstitutional encroachment ' on the governor 's power . 
Thursday 's ruling is the final word on the case , but Hood said he would seek to get the notice requirement restored to the state charter . 
   We do respect the decision of the Court , but feel deeply for how it must weigh on the victims and their families . It is these victims and family members who have lost today and the criminals who have won , ' he said in a statement , echoing Randolph 's dissent . 
Among the 214 inmates Barbour pardoned before he left office in January were four convicted murderers who had worked as    trusties ' at the governor 's mansion . Critics argued that the governor failed to consider the families of their victims before freeing them . 
All four and an armed robber also pardoned by Barbour had remained free while the issue worked its way through the courts , and were freed under Thursday 's decision . Five other inmates who had remained behind bars awaiting a ruling have been released . 
Barbour has defended his pardons and said the former inmates had been rehabilitated .
