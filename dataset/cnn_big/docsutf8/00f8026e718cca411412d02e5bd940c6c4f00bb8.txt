Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The much-maligned , color-coded Homeland Security Advisory System is about to be consigned to the proverbial dustbin of history . 
Not that anyone is really paying attention . 
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is expected to announce Thursday that the almost 9-year-old threat alert system will go away in April . It will be replaced by the new National Terror Advisory System that will focus on specific threats in geographical areas , a department source said Wednesday . 
The source did not provide details of the new system , which Napolitano will unveil at what the department is calling    the first annual   State of America 's Homeland Security  address ' at George Washington University . 
The top Democrat and Republican on the House Homeland Security Commission reacted positively to the news , although committee chairman Rep. Peter King , R-New York , reserved judgment on the specifics . 
   Though the system served a valuable purpose in the terrible days and months following the terrorist attacks of September 11 , it was clearly time for the current color-coded system to be replaced with a more targeted system , ' King said .    I know they have been working on this for a long time . It sounds to me like the changes they are proposing make sense . We will have to wait and see how they implement this new , more targeted system . I expect the biggest challenge for DHS will be balancing the need to provide useful and timely information with the need to protect sensitive information . ' 
   The old color coded system taught Americans to be scared , not prepared , ' said ranking member Rep. Bennie Thompson , D-Mississippi .    Each and every time the threat level was raised , very rarely did the public know the reason , how to proceed , or for how long to be on alert . I have raised concerns for years about the effectiveness of the system and have cited the need for improvements and transparency . Many in Congress felt the system was being used as a political scare tactic -- raising and lowering the threat levels when it best suited the Bush administration . ' 
President George W. Bush established the Homeland Security Advisory System by presidential directive on March 11 , 2002 , just a few months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington . The five levels -- green for low , blue for guarded , yellow for elevated , orange for high and red for severe -- were intended to identify the risk of terrorist attack . 
The initial level was yellow , which the system retained until September 11 , 2002 , when it was raised to orange to cover the first anniversary of the attacks . It was lowered back to yellow on September 24 . 
In its lifetime , the threat level has been raised to orange/high five times , although it went to that level three other times for specific industries . The threat level was raised to red/severe once -- on August 10 , 2006 , and only for commercial flights from the United Kingdom to the United States -- when British authorities announced they had disrupted a major plot to blow up aircraft . The level went down to orange on August 16 , 2006 , where it remains . 
The general threat level is yellow/elevated . The two lower levels have never been used , and task force looking at the system recommended in 2009 eliminating them altogether and making yellow the lowest threat level but renaming it    guarded . ' 
Almost from the start , the threat level system was the butt of jokes and multiple parodies . 
The    Democracy Threat Advisory Level ' went from green/low -LRB-    Wow , clean money systems really work ' -RRB- to red/severe -LRB-    Martial law , but it 's for your own good ' -RRB- . 
A    Total Headcase Advisory System ' began with    George Soros is arrested ' and ended with    Hillary Clinton is elected president . ' Still another announced that Homeland Security and Crayola had jointly revised the system , changing green to aquamarine , blue to raw umber , yellow to burnt sienna , orange to neon carrot and red to cotton candy . 
The public did n't care much for the system either , with polls conducted at the time indicating most Americans found it confusing and not very useful . 
More seriously , however , some critics accused the Bush administration of using using the system to generate fear at politically sensitive times , such as just before the 2004 election . And just days after his 2005 resignation , then-Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge told a Washington forum that he sometimes disagreed with the rationale for raising the alert but was overruled by others on the Homeland Security Advisory Council , which made the decisions . 
The council included Attorney General John Ashcroft , FBI chief Robert Mueller , CIA director George Tenet , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell . 
   More often than not we -LRB- the department -RRB- were the least inclined to raise it , ' Ridge told reporters after the forum .    Sometimes we disagreed with the intelligence assessment . Sometimes we thought even if the intelligence was good , you do n't necessarily put the country on -LRB- alert -RRB- . ... There were times when some people were really aggressive about raising it , and we said ,   For that ?  ' 
And in 2009 , Ridge wrote in a tell-all book that sometimes officials such as Ashcroft and Rumsfeld pressured the department to change the level , describing a 2004 event in which his arguments against raising the alert worked . 
   I believe our strong interventions had pulled the   go-up  advocates back from the brink . But I consider the episode to be not only a dramatic moment in Washington 's recent history , but another illustration of the intersection of politics , fear , credibility and security , ' he wrote . 
   After that episode , I knew I had to follow through with my plans to leave the federal government , ' he wrote . 
Ridge announced his resignation on November 30 , 2004 , and left office on February 1 , 2005 . 
The Bush administration denied Ridge 's assertions , however . 
   Nobody 's more surprised than I am , ' then-Homeland Security adviser Fran Townsend told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer .    Of course , Tom Ridge never expressed those concerns while he was in the administration , nor did he when I spoke to him after he left ... -LRB- He -RRB- was n't the only one in that meeting who suggested the terror alert should n't be raised . At no time was there a discussion of politics in that meeting . And the president was made a consensus recommendation from the council that he accepted -- not to raise the terror alert . ' 
Townsend is now a national security contributor for CNN .
