-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Announcement of a Nintendo 2DS handheld console is causing a collective    eh ' among fans of the pioneering gaming company . 
The new console hopes to entice the entry-level gamer -LRB- i.e. kids -RRB- with a large catalog of games designed for the Nintendo 3DS and DS while appealing to parents with a low price point -LRB- $ 129 -RRB- . Unlike its counterpart , the 2DS does not have 3-D visual effects , nor can it be folded shut like other DS handheld consoles . 
Instead , the 2DS remains flat and fixed , much like a tablet . The controls are similar to other Nintendo handheld consoles and screen sizes are the same as the 3DS unit . 
While critics are split over whether this is a good idea for the company in the long term , fans in forums and social media are shaking their heads . Some are asking why a 2DS model is needed when 3-D can be turned off on the current console , while others are calling for Nintendo executives  heads . 
Much of the confusion lies in the naming convention . While the Nintendo DS can only play DS games , the 2DS and 3DS can play games designed for the DS or the 3DS . 
The problem arises because the games are clearly labeled for the DS or the 3DS , but not for the 2DS , and could have parents wondering ,    Where are the 2DS games ? ' 
It was a similar problem when the Wii U was announced and players could n't play Wii U on Wii systems . The names were n't distinct enough to create separation for a casual audience . 
The move to a non3-D environment for the handheld console is a welcome one to some fans .    Oh I 'm so happy they 're creating a 2DS , ' said @omglazerkittens on Twitter .    That 's the whole reason I have n't bought one yet . ' 
Nintendo , for its part , has said the new device is designed for young kids , despite having promotional videos with adults using it . 
Despite the nonplussed reaction from many older gamers , some fans understand the need for a device aimed at the young audience . 
The new console may appeal to    parents who want to buy their kids PokÃ © mon and a 3DS at an affordable price , ' wrote Haziq , a member of popular online video-gaming forum NeoGAF .    Plus , the flat design kind of reminds me of a tablet . I would n't be surprised if this is Nintendo 's way of directly competing with that market for small kids . ' 
The October 12 release for the Nintendo 2DS is the same day the company plans to launch the latest titles in the Pokemon universe ,    Pokemon X ' and    Pokemon Y. ' 
But other gamers are n't so quick to accept the need for the new console or Nintendo 's explanation . 
   To those who say the 2DS is a kid-friendly option , where does the inability to protect the screen with folding fall into that ? ' wrote @JustinMcElroy on Twitter . 
Twitter user @kellyherron27 wonders whether Nintendo is not happy with the 3DS market anymore .    Feels like they 're saying ,   OK , so our novelty really is a gimmick . Oops .  ' 
But in explaining the need for the Nintendo 2DS , another NeoGAF member may have offered the most clear-eyed assessment . 
   Parents will be buying this for kids and that 's the point , hence the price , ' wrote Alpha_eX .    They 're aiming at kids wanting the new PokÃ © mon game and if parents can get it cheap , it 'll sell over a more expensive 3DS model . ' 
   This console is n't aimed at any of us -LRB- adults -RRB- . '
