-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Renowned radio personality Casey Kasem is in critical condition at a hospital in western Washington , a spokesman for St. Anthony Hospital told CNN in a written statement Thursday . 
   Mr. Kasem is alert and appears comfortable at this time , ' Scott Thompson , a spokesman for the facility in Gig Harbor added . 
The 82-year-old former host of    American Top 40 ' and    Casey 's Top 40 ' is receiving antibiotics through IVs , blood pressure support medicine and care for his bed sores , Thompson said . 
Kasem was admitted to the hospital Sunday after one of his daughters and an ambulance crew retrieved him from a home where he and his wife were staying with friends . 
   Any further updates on Mr. Kasem 's condition will be at the discretion and approval of his children , ' Thompson said . 
Danny Deraney , a representative of daughter Kerri Kasem , told CNN that members of the family , including Casey Kasem 's brother , were flying to Washington . When asked if they feared Casey Kasem might die , Deraney said it could be his last moments or he could get better . Deraney clarified that he never meant that Kasem 's health was failing as was reported by several media outlets . 
On Thursday , a message appeared on the Twitter account of Deraney PR , saying that Kasem was in    stable condition . ' A patient can be listed as both critical and stable , if his condition is poor but not deteriorating further . 
The radio icon has been at the center of a family feud between Jean Kasem , his wife of 34 years , and his three children from his first marriage . 
Kerri Kasem ; her sister , Julie ; and their brother , Mike Kasem , have contended since last year that Jean Kasem has prevented the three siblings from visiting their father . 
Kasem has Lewy body disease , the most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer 's , and has been bed-ridden for some time . 
He had been at a facility in Santa Monica , California , before Jean Kasem took him to Washington state after his daughter Kerri Kasem won temporary conservatorship over her father 's care . 
Last week , a Washington court granted Kerri Kasem the right to visit her father one hour a day and to have him examined by a doctor . 
On Friday afternoon , a Kitsap County judge will continue the hearing and get an update on the situation , Deraney said . 
Deraney expected the judge to rule on whether Jean Kasem would have to let Kerri Kasem have more input on where her father lives and who cares for him . 
Casey Kasem , who was also the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon    Scooby-Doo ' and an announcer for NBC , retired in 2009 .
