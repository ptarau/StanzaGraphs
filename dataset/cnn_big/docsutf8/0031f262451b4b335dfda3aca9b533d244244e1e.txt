-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Four years ago , Brandon Stanton became New York City 's unofficial photo-chronicler . With his blog , Humans of New York -- which has over eight million followers on social media -- he has captured the heart and soul of the city 's multi-national inhabitants . 
His trademark -- the micro narratives that accompany each image -- has been imitated in the far reaches of the globe , from Sydney to Khartoum . 
Last month , he turned his lens , and poignant interview style , to the world at large . In partnership with the United Nations , he is touring roughly a dozen countries in a bid to raise awareness for the peacekeeping organization 's Millennium Development Goals . His first stop : Iraq and Jordan . 
  My eyes were opened  
Though his trip was    months in the works , ' Stanton did n't anticipate that his arrival in Erbil , Iraq would coincide with that of ISIS . The first people he questioned were Yazidi refugees who had only freshly fled their homes , their families , their lives as a whole . 
   My idea of what constitutes personal tragedy has been expanded a lot just listening to what these people are going through , ' admits Stanton . 
For the Yazidis he approached -- from the student who had to abandon his long sought after Master 's degree to flee bombs to the mother whose children ca n't stop crying for home -- Stanton found himself falter at the prospect of pursuing his traditional line of questioning . 
   When you 've just abandoned your house , and your family is surrounded by a hostile army , and you do n't know if they 're going to survive , it 's just inappropriate to ask what your happiest memory with your mother is , ' he says . 
   I felt I could n't ask them beyond their present circumstances , because their lives were absolutely consumed by those circumstances . ' 
  Pack a bag and get ready to run  
The day Stanton landed in Iraq , ISIS captured the Mosul Dam . The day he left , the United States started air strikes . His time there , he admits , was often terrifying . 
   When I was in Dohuk , there was a moment I got a call in the middle of the night from UNICEF telling to pack a bag and get ready to run , because ISIS was shelling the town and had broken through the lines , ' he recalls . 
   It was an abundance of caution it turned out , but it was a sleepless night . ' 
It was one of many moments , he admits , when he appreciated what it means to feel secure . 
   I went to this place where all people wanted was a bit of security : to send their kids to school , to start a business , to get married and live a normal life . And I realized that in the absence of physical security , no other layers of life can really be experienced , ' he says . 
   That constant uncertainty seeps into your psyche in a way that you ca n't really pinpoint until you go back to a place that is secure . ' 
For Stanton , that place was Jordan . 
   I really noticed when I landed in Jordan , where the infrastructures was in place and there was no imminent threat , that there was a load lifted from my psyche , ' he says . 
The stories he heard were different as well . The tenor , though often still heart-breaking -LRB- he visited Zaatari Refugee Camp that houses around 80,000 Syrians -RRB- , demonstrated a lighter side of the human character . In the absence of immediate danger , there was hope . 
   The other thing this trip has made me realize is the depth of ambition , particularly in underdeveloped countries , ' he says . 
   Everybody I talked to had such big dreams , and often such limited opportunities with which to achieve those dreams . '
