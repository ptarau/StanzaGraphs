When Harry returned home the morning after the typhoon struck , he found part of the roof missing from his home . 
It was n't as bad as Yolanda , ' he said , referring to Typhoon Haiyan , which completely destroyed his house in the Magallanes    barangay , ' or district , of Tacloban a year ago .    It was so scary . ' 
Much of his barangay , which lies close to the water 's edge , was decimated by the storm surge that was generated by the most powerful storm ever to make landfall in November , 2013 . It is also one of the poorest areas in Tacloban . 
Little more than a year on and most people in this traumatized town in the central Philippines will be incredibly relieved that Typhoon Hagupit , which passed some 50 kilometers north , came with nothing like the force of Haiyan . Most of what has been rebuilt in the past few months has largely remained intact . 
Harry was one of many who heeded official warnings to evacuate to safer areas during the storm -- he was not going to repeat the mistake he made last year of trying to ride it out . 
Surveying the damage around his modest home , its walls held up by various metal sheets and cardboard boxes , Harry seemed remarkably positive :    It 's not so bad . ' Pointing at the missing part of his ceiling above his living area and kitchen , he added :    It was not nailed down as well as the other area of roof . ' 
He 'll just repair it again like last time . 
TYPHOON TRACKER : Follow Hagupit 's path 
Checking for damage 
This was a typical scene across Tacloban on Sunday morning , as some 48,000 people anxiously prepared to return to their homes from evacuation centers to check the damage . 
According to the mayor and the city 's disaster management authorities , there have so far been no casualties and power should be restored in the next day or so . 
Clearing up is more about mopping up ; torrential rains drenched the entire area , flooding many roads . Though the storm was nowhere near as powerful as last year 's , authorities took no chances and were prepared for what was to come . 
Our next stop was the Santa Nino church , a building that became symbolic of the damage done by Haiyan . Almost leveled completely , it was in the process of being renovated . Hagupit spared it this time around -- the only clues to what took place the night before were lots of tree branches and roots strewn around the surrounding streets . 
Still waiting for homes 
Many people in Tacloban are still living in tents or other rudimentary structures more than a year after Haiyan . They 've been promised new homes but the process has been extremely slow . 
For those lucky enough to get one , they 're often located miles away . They may be away from vulnerable , flood-prone areas , but they 're also far from where they work , shops and their friends . These are the main reasons why many have chosen -- against the wishes of the government -- to rebuild their basic shanty homes in areas like Magallanes and San Jose . 
Yet some like Lucrecia Simbajon , 58 , another resident of Magallanes , would jump at the chance of a new home if only she was offered one . She and her family are among hundreds who have spent the last few days camped out at the local Roman Catholic    Redemption ' church . 
   I do n't know how long I 'm going to be here , as the roof was blown off my house last night , ' she said . Her home -- a typical wooden and metal shack -- was wiped out last year . As a result , she spent more than 20 days at the Redemption , lying between pews with her children . Though it is easily the sturdiest building in the area , the church 's perforated roof is a reminder that Haiyan spared little in its path . 
Simbajon does n't know how she 'll carry out the repairs this time around . Her house is located in an area declared a    no build zone ' because it was so close to the coast and therefore vulnerable to storm surges .    We need help from the government -- financial assistance , materials , so we can rebuild , ' she said . They got no help after Haiyan , she added . Aside from delivering parcels of rice and noodles , she said no one from the government had been near over the past few days . 
Asked if she 'd consider one of the new houses the local government pledged to build in the wake of Haiyan , she was emphatic :    We no longer have a home here . For my family we are willing to move , to transfer . ' 
Sheltering in chapel 
The atmosphere inside the main chapel at the Redemption was far calmer than a day earlier when everyone nervously awaited the arrival of Hagupit -- these were among the town 's poorest and most vulnerable . A white board listed everyone who was evacuated here , including several heavily pregnant women . 
Alita Castillo , another local , is also a volunteer with a local NGO dealing with disaster risk reduction . Her entire family is staying in an adjacent hall .    We 're more prepared this year , with more people prepared to leave their houses , ' she said .    Last year , we had 70 families staying with us in the church . This time we have more than 200 . ' 
Yet she and her family still do n't have a house , more than a year after Haiyan . And now the house she had been staying in has been badly damaged . 
   I do n't know where we 'll go this time , ' she said .    We helped organize a home owner 's association and luckily , with help from the church , the United Nations , and a few other groups , we 'll be eligible for free housing -- but it 's still in the process . Hopefully two years from now I will have one . '
