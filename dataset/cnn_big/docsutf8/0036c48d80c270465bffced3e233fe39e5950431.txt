-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A memorial cruise is scheduled to set sail 100 years after the sinking of the Titanic , following the same trans-Atlantic route as the ill-fated ship , according to organizers . 
A list of first class passengers for the R.M.S. Titanic is one of the artifacts that remains after the sinking . 
The Titanic Memorial Cruise is to set sail in April 2012 , departing from Southampton , England , on April 8 , just as the Titanic did . 
On April 15 , the ship -- the Balmoral -- will arrive at the spot in the North Atlantic where the Titanic sank after it collided with an iceberg . 
Passengers on the 2012 cruise will take part in a memorial service at the site , according to organizer Miles Morgan Travel . 
Artifacts from the Titanic and a piece of the ship 's hull have been recovered , but most of the wreckage remains where the luxury cruise liner sank . 
The 12-night memorial cruise will then take passengers to Halifax in Nova Scotia , Canada , so they can visit cemeteries where some of the Titanic victims are buried . The trip will end in New York , where the Titanic was headed . Prices for the trip start at $ 3,900 . 
Millvina Dean , thought to be the last survivor of the Titanic , died in June 2009 at age 97 , according to friends . 
Dean was an infant when the Titanic -- publicized as    practically unsinkable ' and as the largest passenger steamship at the time -- struck an iceberg on the night of April 14 , 1912 , during its maiden voyage from Southampton in southern England to New York . The ship sank less than three hours later , killing more than 1,500 people . 
Dean 's brother and mother also survived the sinking .
