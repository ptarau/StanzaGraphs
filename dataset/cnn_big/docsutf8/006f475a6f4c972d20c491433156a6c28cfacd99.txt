-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- First there was friendship . Then there was romance . After that there was marriage . 
And now , at what would have been a few weeks from her senior year in college , Christian Minard finds herself expelled from school -- because the person she married is another woman . 
In a letter from earlier this month that Minard shared with CNN , an administrator at Southwestern Christian University noted that he 'd been told of Minard 's same-sex marriage and saw pictures of it posted to Facebook . 
Such a union is in apparent conflict with the    lifestyle covenant ' of the university    that all students must agree and sign , ' he added . 
   As an American and a Christian , I do respect your choice , ' the administrator wrote . ' -LRB- But -RRB- I have to uphold the Lifestyle Covenant at SCU and confront you with our position . 
   Due to this recent event , you will not be able to attend SCU in the future . ' 
When asked to confirm that the school -- which describes itself as part of the    International Pentecostal Holiness ' denomination -- sent the letter and to elaborate on the decision , the school 's provost , Connie Sjoberg , said only that federal law    prohibits us from confirming if an individual is or has been a student at our institution . ' 
Sjoberg added ,    We therefore can not comment on your specific request . ' 
Did Minard sign the school 's morality covenant ? Yes , she concedes . But she still thinks her expulsion is unfair . Plenty of other students violate the contract in one way or another without being expelled , she says . Minard thinks she is singled out because she 's a lesbian . 
In addition to the emotional sting , the 22-year-old says she is now stuck personally -- not knowing what to do , or where to go next . 
   I 'm trying to figure out how and where I can graduate , ' she told CNN , noting that she 'll have to start paying off her loans at the end of next year unless things change . ' ... It 's going to be hard to get into classes that may be full , because they gave me very little notice before the fall semester starts . '

Believes   gay lifestyle  compatible with   faith in God  
Located in the metropolitan Oklahoma City community of Bethany , Southwestern Christian University 's website states the school 's three core values are scholarship , service and spirit . The latter value includes    building a Christ-centered community , '    honoring our Pentecostal Holiness heritage ' and    respecting diversity and various Christian backgrounds . ' 
Minard came to the school on scholarship for basketball , though her playing career was cut short after doctors told her -- after she 'd suffered multiple concussions -- that she should avoid sports with physical contact . 
   I stayed on without a scholarship , ' Minard said ,    because I was so invested in the university and knew that some credits would n't transfer to other schools . ' 
Meanwhile , her life was changing in other ways as well . 
About 3Ã‚ 1/2 years ago , she met her future spouse , Kadyn Park . They started out as friends , and romance blossomed over time .    We eventually fell in love and decided to get married , ' Minard said . 
The couple wed March 17 in Albuquerque , New Mexico -- a state where same-sex marriage is legal . 
She had planned to become a strength and conditioning coach .    Once I graduated , ' Minard said ,    I was willing to go wherever life took me . ' 
Her educational and professional path , though , is now far from clear . 
Yet Minard feels that she 's in the right place in her own spiritual journey . 
Having grown up in the Lutheran Church , Minard notes that she    at first ... struggled ' with the idea that her faith was at odds with her sexuality . 
   I had questions , but I worked through those questions , ' she said .    And now I have a strong faith in God . And I believe you can still have faith in God and live a gay lifestyle . '
