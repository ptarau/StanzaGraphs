-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- European football 's governing body , UEFA has revealed that 32 of its 54 member states have declared an interest in hosting matches at the 2020 European Championships . 
Traditionally , the tournament is hosted by one or two nations , but matches in 2020 will be shared between 13 cities across Europe . 
UEFA , who announced a change in format for the tournament 's 60th anniversary last December , welcomed the enthusiastic response from the national football associations . 
   We are extremely proud to see the huge interest in the bidding process , with more than half of our member associations willing to host matches at UEFA EURO 2020 , ' UEFA President Michel Platini said . 
   The finals will be a great celebration of football across the European continent , and the 60th anniversary edition will be truly special , by really coming to the doorstep of all football fans . ' 
Platini initially floated the idea following the 2012 championships hosted by Poland and Ukraine and a decision to change the format was agreed by UEFA 's Executive Committee last December before being confirmed in January . 
The format , dubbed a    Euro for Europe , ' has attracted interest from reigning Euro champions , Spain and the other traditional powerhouses of European football -- Germany , France , Italy , Netherlands , Portugal , Greece and England . 
   UEFA 's   EURO for Europe  in 2020 promises to be a fitting way to recognise 60 years of the UEFA European Championship , ' said England Football Association secretary Alex Horne in a statement . 
   It would be great to see England playing in front of their home fans here in London as part of a EURO Finals tournament but many countries have also put themselves forward as hosts and we expect this to be a very competitive bidding process . ' 
Less illustrious footballing nations including Armenia , Israel , Kazakhstan and Wales have also thrown their hat into the ring . 
UEFA says all 32 associations can submit a maximum of two bids -- one which covers three group matches and one knockout round and another which will vie to host the semifinal and final .
