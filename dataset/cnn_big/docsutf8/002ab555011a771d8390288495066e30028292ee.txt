1 . Always look the part 
Most of the time I slap on some makeup in the morning so I do n't look bad if somebody snaps a picture . Somebody , somewhere , will catch you , even if it 's a fan at the grocery store . Very rarely do I go out without makeup . 
2 . Keep a food diary 
I 'm OCD like that . I count calories , fat and fiber -- which is important in making you feel fuller faster -- and protein , especially when I 'm working out . Watch how Carrie handles romantic distress ' 
3 . Do n't be a dairy queen 
Cheese is ruining my life ! I 'm trying to talk myself into being lactose-intolerant . I mean , it 's basically moldy milk , and it does n't smell that great -- but it 's so good ! Oh , jeez , I 'm thinking about it now ... 
4 . Exercise your options 
Always take an hour for yourself to go do something positive . I like the elliptical machine or swimming if I 'm in a hotel with a decent pool and there are n't too many people there . I also do the treadmill , free weights , exercise ball . If it 's a nice day , outdoor activity is nice . I get a bike and ride around . Plus , I get a decent cardio workout every night onstage . 
5 . Do n't break the bank 
I do n't buy expensive jewelry and fur coats and Escalades . I 've never bought a car in my life . The car I have , a Ford Mustang convertible , is the one I won on Idol -- I guess I need to go buy a new car after all ! 
6 . Smell yummy 
I do n't do smelly soaps or wear perfume , so lotion is kind of my perfume . My favorite body lotion is Benefit 's Maybe Baby . It 's got a little shimmer in it . If I 'm dressing up I might use perfume . I have a couple by Anna Sui . And Gwen Stefani 's perfume -LSB- L -RSB- , is good too . 
7 . Be a girlie girl 
With makeup I think it 's important for girls to play . I mix a lot . I 'll put on lip gloss and go ,    That needs to shimmer . ' So I 'll put something shimmery on top . Then I want it a little pinker , so I put pink on top . But it all comes together . I 'm trying to lay off the black eyeliner , though -- I love it a little too much . 
8 . Go with the flow 
I tend to go after bigger , flowy tops or dresses . I know I 'm doing myself a disservice , but I 'd rather put on a muumuu and have people at least think there might be a skinny person underneath than put on something tight and have them think , Look at that gut ! 
9 . Laugh at yourself 
Usually I come up through the floor to get to the stage . I ca n't stand up on the little platform or the audience will see me , so I 'm squatting down with my rear end pressed up against the back of it . I just laugh because the audience thinks this is so glamorous -- and here I am under the stage with these ropes and equipment , my butt pressed against plastic ! E-mail to a friend
