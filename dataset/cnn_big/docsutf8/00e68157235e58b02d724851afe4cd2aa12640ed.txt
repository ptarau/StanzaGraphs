-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- BlackBerry customers slammed by last week 's global outage are being offered free apps , not cash , as payback for their troubles . 
At least a dozen apps , which would cost about $ 100 on the BlackBerry App World site , will be made available in the next few weeks , according to a statement released Monday by BlackBerry maker Research In Motion . 
   We truly appreciate and value our relationship with our customers , ' RIM Co-CEO Mike Lazaridis said in the statement .    We 've worked hard to earn their trust over the past 12 years , and we 're committed to providing the high standard of reliability they expect , today and in the future . ' 
An October 10 failure at a data center caused outages in Europe and elsewhere , RIm said . RIM throttled service to help address the outage , which spread over the next few days to Europe , the Middle East , India , Africa , Latin America and North America . Full service was restored on Thursday , according to the company . 
The free apps include : 
* SIMS 3 
* Bejeweled 
* N.O.V.A. 
* Texas Hold 'em Poker 2 
* Bubble Bash 2 
* Photo Editor Ultimate - Ice Cold Apps 
* DriveSafe.ly Pro 
* Drive Safe.ly Enterprise 
* Nobex Radioâ „ cents Premium 
* Shazam Encore 
* Vlingo Plus : Virtual Assistant 
More apps will be added later , according to the statement . The first ones will become available on Wednesday and they 'll stay free for the rest of the year . 
Business customers also will be offered a free month of technical support . 
The offer seemed to please at least some of BlackBerry 's roughly 70 million customers . 
   Only 1 simple word for this ... AMAZING !!! ' wrote one visitor to a post on the BlackBery fan site , Crackberry .    I was n't expecting this at all , but it is welcome . ' 
   Trust restored RIM ! ... , ' wrote another .    This also tells you RIM is very , very serious with surviving . No giving up for them . ' 
But response was more measured among less-enthusiastic customers . 
   What a useless   compensation  , ' wrote one commenter on the website for London 's Guardian newspaper .    What -LSB- if -RSB- somebody uses their device for communications -LRB- e.g. e-mail -RRB- rather than using loads of apps ? The value in apps is totally worthless . ' 
Many had been hoping to at least be reimbursed for the amount of time their service was out . 
By comparison , after Sony 's PlayStation Network went down this spring , the company offered players free games , a weekend of free video rentals and a free month of PlayStation Plus , a premium subscription service offering exclusive titles , discounts and other perks . That PlayStation outage lasted the better part of a month for some customers .
