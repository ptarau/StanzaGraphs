-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Florida judge sentenced Rachel Wade , the 20-year-old woman convicted of second-degree murder for fatally stabbing her romantic rival in a fight last year , to 27 years in prison Friday . 
While acknowledging mitigating factors -- primarily Wade 's youth and lack of a criminal past -- the judge said her actions were not    unaggravating . ' 
   The murder was no accident , ' Judge Joseph Bulone said . 
Wade went to trial in July , accused of second-degree murder in the stabbing death of 18-year-old Sarah Ludemann . The two women , only teenagers at the time , had fought for months via voicemails , text messages and MySpace postings over their relationship with the same man , Joshua Camacho . 
The feud culminated in a fatal confrontation in the early morning hours of April 15 , 2009 . 
After a three-day trial and only two and a half hours of deliberation , a jury of five men and one woman convicted Wade of second-degree murder . Wade had claimed self-defense and hoped for an acquittal or no more than a manslaughter conviction . 
A life sentence was recommended by Florida prosecutors . The defense had recommended 15 years , followed by 15 years of probation . 
TruTV 's    In Session ' correspondent Beth Karas spoke to Wade days before her sentencing . 
   I think about it every day , regardless if they give me five years or 20 years more than they could give me , ' Wade said .    I never meant to do it , and I 'm still gon na have to live with it , no matter if I 'm home or if I 'm in prison . ' 
Wade 's lawyer told HLN Friday that the sentence was    very fair . ' 
   I just do n't think this was a case that called for life , ' said Jay Hebert . 
Hebert said the case is a cautionary tale about the potentially deadly mix of young people and modern communications technology . 
   When you start looking at the tragic nature of this , the social networking , the instant messaging , the ability of people to hide behind the screen and make statements and create situations -- it just festered until it bubbled up and exploded into a situation ... until two good girls , their worlds collided , ' he said . 
Hebert said Wade has resolved to teach young people about the dangers associated with social networking . 
   I do n't think we can appreciate how young people talk , ' he said .    And that 's the lesson for parents . Pay close attention to your children . Watch how they talk and who they talk to . Watch their social networking outlets . ' 
   Because it 's an explosive situation when when you do n't have to be accountable , when you can break up with somebody or ask somebody to prom via text , ' he said .    There 's no face-to-face interaction . '
