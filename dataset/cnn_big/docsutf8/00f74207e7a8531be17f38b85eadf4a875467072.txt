Beijing -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jobs and money , national identity and political stability . 
These are some of the contentious issues driving the presidential election in Taiwan this weekend . 
Seeking another four-year term is the incumbent president Ma Ying Jeou of the ruling Kuomintang Party , pitted against Tsai Ing-wen , leader of the Democratic Progressive Party -LRB- DPP -RRB- . 
Who wins the election will influence Taiwan 's relations with mainland China and impact business , geopolitics and security in the region , including China-U.S. ties . 
For many Taiwanese electorates , political observers say , the main issues are jobs , economics and Taiwanese identity . 
For the policy-makers in Beijing , however , the overriding question is whether the next Taiwan president will stick to the status quo . 
That means abiding by the    1992 Consensus , ' a tacit and ambiguous agreement reached 20 years ago between Beijing and Taipei under which both sides agreed on the principle of    one China ' without agreeing on how it is to be defined or interpreted . 
Despite the ambiguity , the 1992 Consensus has served as the basis for cross-strait dialogue that has led in recent years to the unprecedented blossoming of economic and people-to-people ties across the Taiwan Strait . 
In Beijing 's view ,    zuguo tongyi , ' or reunification of the motherland , is a matter of national pride and iron-clad policy . 
Beijing says it prefers to do so peacefully but refuses to rule out the use of force to keep Taiwan from declaring itself a separate state . 
China keeps hundreds of missiles aimed at Taiwan , an ominous threat to the island to stay in the fold . 
War in the Taiwan Strait would prompt a China-U.S. standoff . 
In 1954 , the U.S. and Taiwan signed a mutual defense treaty . Even now , Washington sells Taiwan advanced jet fighters and other military hardware . 
America is also bound by the Taiwan Relations Act , U.S. legislation passed in 1979 , to consider an attack on the island as    a threat to the peace and security ' of the region and    of grave concern to the U.S. ' 
But all these years , Washington has avoided spelling out what it would do in case military clash erupts in the Taiwan Strait . 
Some observers say such ambiguity serves as a deterrent . Others worry it could lead to miscalculations . 
That delicate balance lurks at the heart of this weekend 's election . 
Incumbent president Ma Ying Jeou advocates maintaining the status quo .    Ma Ying Jeou will continue the 1992 Consensus , ' says Tsinghua University professor Yan Xuetong . 
   If he does that we can maintain the current relationship across the Strait . ' 
If Ma wins , says Wang Jianmin , a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences -LRB- CASS -RRB- in Beijing ,    we can hopefully keep the   peaceful development  scenario with the mutual trust based on the 1992 Consensus . ' 
Beijing 's policy-makers are wary of Tsai Ing-wen , suspecting her of pushing a pro-independence agenda . Tsai for one rejects the 1992 Consensus and instead calls for a yet undefined    Taiwan Consensus . ' 
Jia Qingling , a top communist party official who oversees Taiwan affairs , recently warned :    If we deny the status quo there is no way to carry on any further negotiations , and what we have achieved so far would be in vain . We would go back to the days of chaos and uncertainty . ' 
But Wang believes relations between Beijing and Taipei will see a drastic change if DPP gets elected . 
   There is no way China will keep the current level of talks if Taiwan claims itself to be a country , ' he says .    If so , Taiwan 's economy will certainly decline if the life blood from the mainland gets cut off . ' 
But Tsinghua 's Yan Xuetong downplays any worst-case scenarios .    Even if Tsai Ing Wen wins the election , she will adopt a moderate policy to mainland China , ' he opines . 
There are good reasons not to rock the boat , mostly money . 
Closer ties between Taiwan and the mainland , observers say , have brought significant    peace dividends ' to both sides -- robust business and trade , tourism , academic and people-to-people exchanges and family reunions . 
Two-way trade last year topped U.S. $ 160 billion , according to estimates by China 's customs bureau . 
Over the years , Taiwanese investors , big and small , have pumped billions of dollars of investment into China . 
Last year alone , they invested over U.S. $ 12 billion in 520 projects on the mainland , according to a report by the state-run Xinhua new agency . 
Mainland companies , on the other hand , invested U.S. $ 174 million into over 200 projects in Taiwan in the short time since Taiwan allowed mainland investments in June 2009 , Xinhua said . 
Since Taiwan opened its borders to mainland tourists three-and-a-half years ago , says Shao Qiwei , head of China 's tourism agency , over three million mainlanders have visited the island . Last year alone , 1.8 million joined tours or went as individual travelers , Shao added . 
In contrast , about five million Taiwanese tourists visited the mainland last year , according to National Tourism Administration . 
But for the Communist leadership in Beijing closer ties also poses a downside : they bring a democratic contagion to the mainland . 
On Sina Weibo , China 's equivalent of Twitter , Linghutian writes :    No matter who wins , it 's the victory of Taiwan 's voters and the democracy they 've been practicing . We mainlanders should just stay calm and learn something , since we now ca n't really do much . ' 
While the Taiwanese electorate is able to directly elect their president and other leaders this weekend , China 's political elite is still struggling behind closed doors to reach a consensus on who among them will take top positions ahead of the major political transition later this year . 
In the autumn , Vice President Xi Jinping , 58 , is expected to replace 69-year-old Hu Jintao as party chief when the Communist Party holds its national congress -- an event that takes place every five years . Xi is expected to formally ascend as state president when China 's legislature convenes in the spring of 2013 .
