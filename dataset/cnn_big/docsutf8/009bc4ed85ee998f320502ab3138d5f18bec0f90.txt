-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Getting hired or promoted in today 's competitive environment is no easy feat . But , then again , neither was our pitch for MasterCard . 
The rules of the game were made clear : whichever advertising campaign had the best consumer test score would be declared the winner and awarded the MasterCard account . Yet , despite the fact that our now famous    Priceless ' campaign did not fare well in testing , we won the business , and the rest is history . Fifteen years later ,    Priceless ' remains one of the most recognizable ad campaigns in recent history . 
So why did we win the business , defying set rules and what early testing said would be a failure ? According to MasterCard 's CMO Larry Flanagan , it was because of our    core ' -- we were a fighting and a cohesive team of competitors , who believed with every ounce of our beings that this campaign would crush their long-standing competitor , Visa . In other words , we had tapped their    hidden agenda . ' 
The hidden agenda is the unspoken , visceral , emotional motivation that is behind every decision . Whether deciding who wins the billion dollar deal ... or the job , the hidden agenda is always at work . Your mission is to connect to it , and here 's how : 
Do your hidden-agenda homework 
It 's not enough to know factoids about the company . That 's table stakes . Do your homework about the emotional state of the company . Are they on a high , yet searching for the next big thing ? Are they in crisis and in need of a turnaround ? Are they guided by a value system that drives the decisions they make ? 
It turns out that every decision stems from a hidden agenda , which can be found in three forms : 
â $ cents Wants are about people viewing their circumstances through the lens of ambition and confidence . 
â $ cents Needs are about viewing circumstances through the lens of fear or concern . 
â $ cents Values are about people viewing the world entirely through the lens of their belief systems . 
In addition to understanding the company 's hidden agenda , study the person who will be interviewing you to determine their hidden agenda . 
Connect with your real ambition 
I had breakfast a few weeks ago with a very compelling young man . This electrifying fellow was exuberant , quirky bordering on eccentric , and without pretense . He spoke of what he hoped to create in his life , and I hired him on the spot . 
Your real ambition is a deep desire to create something special that does n't yet exist . It 's bigger than mere ambition because it 's noble . When the person you are trying to reach is touched by your real ambition and makes common cause , they 'll hire you . 
Try this : Think about what you want to accomplish , but precede with the words    I will ... ' Make sure it is seemingly impossible , devoid of practicality and utterly fantastic . You can create a shared bond with your interviewer , because they see you both share a common vision .

Bond with your credo 
A company is many things , but it is a community first . Each community has a set of values that bind them ; I call it a credo , Latin for    I believe . ' Dig deeply and look behind the facts and figures . What does the company you 're applying to believe ? If you want to be part of it , know it and connect yourself to it . 
Try this : Take out a sheet of paper , and write    I believe that ... ' What words would you select ? What values would you express that would make you proud for others to see ? Connections are made because of the beliefs you share . You 'll be hired , because your interviewer will see that your credo syncs perfectly with theirs . 
Ignite with your core 
Your core is what makes you stand out from the pack . While many people have similar traits , your core is comprised of a set of skills , abilities , and strengths that , together , are completely unique to you . And as was the case with MasterCard , your core will be seen as something the company needs -- the    answer to their prayers ' and a means by which you can help them .

Critical to your core is authenticity . As a wonderful mentor once told me when I was presenting what I thought was a perfect version of myself and thinking that the real me was no road to glory : the person you are is the person they want to see . They are hiring you , not a manufactured version of something or someone else . 
Try this : Ask five people who know you well and support you to write down the key characteristics they associate with you . Not only will you be staggered by what you 'll get , but you will also feel proud and affirmed . You mobilize people to hire you , because their vital needs are satisfied by the authenticity and sincerity of your core . 
Your pursuit for the promotion or job of your dreams is not a fact and figures game -- it is a human game . When you make a profound connection with the emotional desire of your boss or interviewer , the facts and figures will take the backseat , every time .
