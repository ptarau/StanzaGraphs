-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Barcelona beat Real Madrid 3-2 at the Camp Nou on Wednesday to claim the Spanish Super Cup in an ill-tempered El Clasico clash . 
Lionel Messi 's volley two minutes from time secured a 5-4 aggregate triumph for Josep Guardiola 's side , after French striker Karim Benzema 's goal in the 82nd minute looked to have forced the Spanish season 's traditional curtain-raiser into extra-time . 
Tempers flared in injury time when Brazilian full-back Marcelo 's dismissal for a lunging tackle on Barca debutant Cesc Fabregas sparked a mass brawl between the two sets of players . 
Barca 's Spain striker David Villa and Real 's Germany playmaker Mesut Ozil were red-carded for their involvement in the melee , despite both players having already been substituted . 
Real coach Jose Mourinho also became involved when he was seen to poke the eye of Guardiola 's assistant Tito Vilanova . 
Recent matches between the two teams have seen similar scenes , with five clashes between the archrivals last season resulting in five red cards . 
Having drawn Sunday 's first leg 2-2 at the Bernabeu , European champions Barca went ahead in the tie when Andres Iniesta latched onto a through ball from FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Messi and clipped a finish over Iker Casillas in the Real goal . 
Copa del Rey winners Real equalized five minutes later , when Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo prodded Benzema 's low cross into the back of the net . 
Barca regained the lead on the brink of half-time , when Messi found the net following a neat back-heel from center-back Gerard Pique . 
Benzema scored a second equalizer for Real before Messi 's late strike stole glory for Barca , but Mourinho was happy with what he saw from his charges . 
   Real Madrid gave a spectacular performance from the first to the last minute , ' Mourinho told the nine-time European champion 's web site .    I just say what I think . We came here to play . 
Former Inter coach Mourinho stopped short of criticizing the referee for sending off two of his players , but the 48-year-old did appear to suggest Barca 's players had made the most of the fouls which were committed . 
   The referee must punish what he deems punishable , ' he said .    Pepe and Marcelo played a great game , one for the entire 90 minutes and the other for 45 . Pepe saw a booking for a minor tackle and Marcelo gave a great performance . 
   I 'm not going to say we 're happy because we did n't win the Spanish Super Cup ; that would be hypocritical of me . We intend to play like men and not fall on the ground at the slightest touch . ' 
Guardiola has now won 11 major honors since becoming Barca coach in 2008 and the former club captain was delighted with his team 's performance . 
   What will stay with me is the inhuman effort of the players , ' he said .    They responded like the players they are : eternal , mythical , unrepeatable , honest , who like to train and play football . 
   Truthfully , seeing the way they responded , it 's a privilege and honor to be their manager . '
