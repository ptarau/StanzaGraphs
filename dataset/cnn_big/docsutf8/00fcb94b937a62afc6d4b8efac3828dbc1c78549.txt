The numbers on both questions are even lower than in 1994 , when an anti-incumbent fever helped Republicans win back control of both the House and the Senate from Democrats . The trend line on those questions goes back to 1991 , when they were first asked . 
   This is not a good year to be an incumbent , regardless of which party you belong to , ' said CNN polling director Keating Holland .    Voters seem equally angry at both Republicans and Democrats this year . ' 
Fifty-six percent of people questioned in the survey say that most Democrats in Congress do not deserve to be re-elected . An equal percentage say that most congressional Republicans do n't deserve re-election . 
The poll suggests Americans are split when it comes to their vote this November , with 47 percent of registered voters saying they will support the Republican candidate in their district for the House of Representatives and 45 percent saying they will back the Democrat . Republicans trailed the Democrats by 6 points in November . 
The voters  cool view of incumbents of both parties    may hurt the Democrats more because there are more Democratic incumbents , ' Holland said .    It 's a change from 2006 , when voters concentrated their anger at GOP members of Congress . ' 
The generic ballot question asked respondents if they would vote for a Democrat or Republican in their congressional district , without naming any specific candidates . 
The Democrats currently hold a 255-178 advantage in the House , with two vacant seats that the Democrats once held . Republicans need to win 40 seats to take back control of the chamber . 
While President Obama is not up for re-election this November , he will be in 2012 , if he decides to run for a second term . According to the poll , 44 percent of registered voters say Obama deserves re-election , with 52 percent saying the president does not deserve a second term in office . The survey also indicates that 49 percent of Americans approve of the job Obama 's doing as president , with half of the public disapproving of his job in the White House . 
   One problem Obama faces may be the perception that Obama is not a middle-class kind of guy , ' Holland said .    Only 4 percent of Americans describe themselves as upper class . But a 45 percent plurality say that Obama belongs to the upper class , with 42 percent saying he is from the middle class and 12 percent describing him as working class . ' 
The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted Friday through Monday , with 1,023 adult Americans , including 954 registered voters , questioned by telephone . The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points both for all Americans and for registered voters .
