-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rip it up and start again . 
As a 20-year-old , Ana Ivanovic claimed the French Open on Roland Garros  clay courts . All the portents suggested great things were ahead of the Serbian . 
Here was a tennis player with an impressive forehand and serve , with the added bonus of being incredibly marketable . 
But six years on , much like the characters Vladimir and Estragon in Samuel Beckett 's play    Waiting for Godot ' -- a drama about the passing of time -- the wait for a second grand slam shows no sign of ending . 
Since that win in Paris in 2008 , Ivanovic has suffered from big-match nerves , serving woes and a series of injury problems . 
It is arguable she has also endured something of an identity crisis , chopping and changing coaching teams along the way . 
Her continuing search to help solve this problem and allow her to feel comfortable in her own skin has led her to appointing a support network who speak the same language . 
   I 've been working really hard , ' Ivanovic told retired grand slam champion Kim Clijsters in an interview for CNN 's Open Court show .    I have a new team with me since Wimbledon and it 's a Serbian team for me for the first time . ' 
Ivanovic 's new team includes coach and hitting partner Nemanja Kontic -- who represented Montenegro in the Davis Cup -- fitness coach Zlatko Novkovic and physio Branko Penic . 
They have all been part of her entourage since her split with British coach Nigel Sears in July , following a second-round exit at Wimbledon . 
Her career is littered with coaches who have come and gone as she has searched for a winning formula to challenge consistently for grand slams . 
Since parting company with her early mentor Zoltan Kuharsky in 2006 , she has employed David Taylor , Craig Kardon , Heinz Gunthardt , Antonio van Grichen and Sears . A number of others have also helped her temporarily as part of the Adidas Player Development program . 
It 's not just coaches that have come and gone . It 's also true of fitness trainers . 
Such constant chopping and changing suggests a player stuck in a rut , desperately searching for a way out of it . 
Her desire to follow up that 2008 French Open win has also led Ivanovic to ponder why she picked up a racket at the age of five in the first place -- for the enjoyment . 
   We are also having more fun and a lot of laughs on the court as well to make it interesting , because the year gets very long , ' she said of her team . 
In Kontic , Ivanovic may not have a wise professor on her hands as she did with Sears , yet the 32-year-old , ranked 1,635 th in men 's doubles , is able to offer her something that respect within the game can not always buy -- a shared cultural identity . 
   I 'm really enjoying someone who speaks the same language and can understand you , ' Ivanovic said . 
Employing a coaching team made up of her compatriots could be key to Ivanovic performing consistently , according to a former grand slam champion turned coach . 
   She 's hooked up with someone she has trust in and she 's finding herself , ' Jo Durie , who won mixed doubles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon , told CNN . 
   It 's about confidence with Ana . Her sense of trust in herself is what she needs . 
   A lot of players on tour jump around with coaches , I can never understand that . You need to get to know someone . ' 
Ivanovic 's solitary grand slam win helped the baseliner become the world No. 1 , for 12 weeks in total . 
Now ranked 14th , she has been outside of the top 10 since June 2009 , partly explained by her inability to reach the final four of a grand slam since that 2008 win over Dinara Safina in Paris . 
Wrist , shoulder , foot , abdominal and hip injuries all took their toll as Ivanovic fell to No. 65 in the rankings . Although she acknowledges that there have been improvements in the demands of the WTA Tour calendar , parts of the worldwide schedule are still difficult for the players . 
   Especially at the end of the year when from America we mostly go back to Europe for a week and then we go to Asia for quite a few weeks , so that 's kind of tiring and hard , ' she said . 
   I know it 's difficult to fit it all around it , but Asia at the end of the year really gets a lot of players . ' 
While her playing fortunes might have fluctuated , Ivanovic 's marketability has never been dented . 
According to Forbes , she was the ninth highest-paid female athlete in 2013 with total earnings of $ 7 million -- brought in largely thanks to lucrative sponsorship deals including Adidas , Yonex , Juice Plux and Dubai Duty Free . 
Ivanovic has had a number of high-profile boyfriends -- including Masters-winning golfer Adam Scott and fellow tennis player Fernando Verdasco -- but as Caroline Wozniacki has discovered , it is tough combining consistency on court with such a relationship . 
Her latest campaign , though , does not look like being clouded by such distraction or , just as importantly , injury . 
Kicking off the 2014 season in Auckland , New Zealand , she ground out a victory against fellow former No. 1 Venus Williams to end a more than two-year title drought . It was the ideal preparation for next week 's Australian Open . 
Despite Ivanovic 's obvious talent , Durie doubts whether her game has the consistency required to win a grand slam . 
   I think she 'll find it difficult , ' added Durie .    She can beat the top players , but to win a grand slam you have to win seven matches . 
   She 's capable of big wins , she can certainly beat players like Serena Williams . But can she beat Petra Kvitova and Serena in a row ? ' 
Clijsters retired for a second time in 2012 , having won four grand slams , as she decided to focus on her family -- and has since had a second child . 
Ivanovic , now 26 , admitted that she too has started thinking about life after tennis . 
   I still feel like there is so much I can achieve and so many tournaments I can win , ' she told the Belgian . 
   I do n't want to put a date to it because I think you feel it when the time is right . Family is a big part of my life and I want to have lots of kids of my own one day . 
   Tennis is a big part of my life , but it 's not my whole life . So definitely I want to achieve what I can on the court and then focus . '
