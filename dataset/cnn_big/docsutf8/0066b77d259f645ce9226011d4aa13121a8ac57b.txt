-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After years spent fighting in some of the world 's worst wars , former U.S. Navy SEAL Kristin Beck says she knows what she wants . 
   I want to have my life , ' she told CNN 's    AC360 . ' 
   I fought for 20 years for life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . I want some happiness . ' 
Beck recently came out as transgender . 
She wrote about the experience in a book ,    Warrior Princess : A U.S. Navy SEAL 's Journey to Coming out Transgender . ' 
Trapped in a man 's body 
It chronicles her life as a young boy and man , known then as Chris Beck . 
Beck deployed 13 times , serving in places such as Bosnia , Afghanistan and Iraq . She earned a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart along the way . 
Though she 's felt trapped in the wrong body since grade school , Beck did n't come out until after she left the military in 2011 . 
Doing so earlier would have been too big a risk . 
Transgender men and women are banned from service . 
   That 's a chance that if I took it , I might be dead today , ' she said . 
   There 's a lot of prejudice out there . There 's been a lot of transgender people who are killed for prejudice , for hatred . When the book came out -- some amazing support and some amazing praises -- but also some pretty amazing bigotry and hatred . ' 
Beck says she does n't need people to love , or even like , her . 
   But I do n't want you to beat me up and kill me . You do n't have to like me , I do n't care . But please do n't kill me . ' 
  No one ever met the real me  
Beck explains her years of hiding as living like an onion . 
Deep down , under various layers , or skins , she hid her female persona . 
   It is a constant , but as you suppress and as you bottle it up , it 's not like on that surface , ' she said . 
   You would never notice it because I can push it so deep , but then it does kinda , like , it gnaws at you . So it 's always there . ' 
Looking back , Beck believes she might have wanted to become a SEAL because they are    the toughest of the tough . ' 
She thought :    I could totally make it go away if I could be at that top level . ... Maybe I could cure myself . ' 
But the feeling of being born in the wrong body never went away . 
And for her entire career , Beck kept her mouth shut . 
She says virtually no one , out of the thousands of people she worked with , knew her secret -- it was so well hidden . 
   No one ever met the real me , ' she said . 
Though her identity was hidden , the rest of what Beck offered was true . 
   I gave true brotherhood . I did my best , 150 % all the time , and I gave strength and honor and my full brotherhood to every military person I ever worked with . '
