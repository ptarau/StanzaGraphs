-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Miles away from the somber ceremony on a tarmac where coffins containing the remains of victims of Flight MH17 were returned , dozens of forensic scientists at a military base in the Netherlands were preparing for the grim task of identifying the remains . 
In all , 298 passengers and crew -- among them dozens of children -- were killed when the packed Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 they were on crashed in eastern Ukraine last Thursday . 
All of the bodies and body parts recovered from the crash site will eventually be brought to Hilversum , Netherlands , where a team of experts from the Dutch national forensics unit -LRB- Landelijk Team Forensische Opsporing -RRB- will do everything they can to return the dead to their loved ones . 
   You do n't know which nationality each body is , ' explains Jos van Roo of LTFO .    So we try to identify all the bodies . We are in contact with the other countries to combine efforts to identify the bodies . ' 
The LTFO has experience of other mass disasters , having worked on the 2004 Asian tsunami , the crash of Afriqiyah Airways Flight 771 in Libya in 2010 and other incidents in the Netherlands . 
Van Roo says great care has and will continue to be taken over the bodies , out of respect for the victims and to avoid any further distress to their families . 
Forensics specialist :   It must be very precise  
It is painstaking work , van Roo says :    There are lot of bodies and body parts coming our way . -LSB- Everything -RSB- must be examined . ... It must be very precise . You must make sure you do n't give the wrong body to the wrong family . ' 
The team 's work began days ago on the Ukrainian field near the Russian border where MH17 's journey from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur came to a premature end . 
Forensic genetics expert Denise Syndercombe-Court of King 's College London says some identifications will be relatively simple . 
   It sounds as if they have perhaps 200 body bags with identifiable bodies or parts of bodies in , ' she says .    And while they have been at the site for some time , I would expect that it will be possible to get good DNA profiles from most of those . ' 
In some cases , working out who is who may be even easier than that -- if a victim has a distinctive scar or clothing , or even a wallet or passport in a pocket . 
Dental records can also be used to identify those who are not immediately recognizable . 
If DNA is needed , it is usually taken from an area of deep muscle . Mitochondrial DNA may also be used . In both cases , the experts will then need to compare the DNA taken from the victim with a relative . 
Search for DNA matches 
But Syndercombe-Court says the fact so many families died on Flight MH17 may complicate the process . 
   Where you have lots of family members traveling together , you may have to rely on DNA matches to more distant relatives , ' she explains .    Once you get beyond the immediate family , beyond grandparents or aunts and uncles , it becomes more difficult . ' 
In those cases , scientists may have to rely on alternative comparisons , matching DNA from the remains to that found on toothbrushes or clothing owned by the dead person . 
Van Roo says work has already begun to collect details and DNA matches for those on board the plane , with dozens of detectives interviewing family members . 
   We have been working with the families of the victims . From them , we ask -LSB- for -RSB- a description of the victim , and we take DNA , look at the dental records and take fingerprints , ' he told CNN , adding that the process of talking to relatives can take a long time . 
   You try to get as much information during your first visit . You do n't want to forget some questions . It is very painful to have to get back to families to ask -LSB- more -RSB- questions . ' 
   Every bit of information you get from a relative needs to be collected very carefully . Also you need to take records from the bodies . It is a delicate procedure for example , -LSB- to -RSB- take dental records or DNA . ' 
Syndercombe-Court helped to identify the victims of Yemenia Flight 626 , which crashed into the Indian Ocean on its way from Yemen to Comoros in 2009 , leaving 152 dead . 
She says not every victim will be easy to put a name to : Cases where the force of a blast or fire have damaged the remains can be complex . 
And she says that while experts do have the passenger manifest , some cases may never be fully resolved . 
But she hopes knowing , at least , that everything possible has been done , and that the remains were handled with great care will offer some solace . 
   The longer it goes on , the more difficult it can be . ... If someone is not found , or a body part is never identified , but it is dealt with in a sensitive way , the families know someone has gone to the effort , someone has tried their best . ' 
For the experts at Hilversum , the next weeks and months will be busy and difficult . Van Roo says the work can be emotional , but everyone is united by their common aim . 
   We have the drive to give the bodies back to the families , ' he says .    Every case is unique , -LSB- but -RSB- you want to get the victim back . The drive stays the same . ' 
Syndercombe-Court agrees :    It 's a tough job , but a good job . 
   It is always grim , but we do it with the knowledge that we are helping someone else : The family want to be able to put it to bed , and we want to give them some peace . '
