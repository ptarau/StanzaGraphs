LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Britain 's Prince Harry turned 25 Tuesday in the knowledge that he is now entitled to part of the multi-million dollar inheritance left to him by his late mother . 
Prince Harry is currently training to become a helicopter pilot with the British Army . 
Harry was just 12 years old when Diana , Princess of Wales , was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997 . 
His mother left an estate worth # 21 million -LRB- $ 35 million -RRB- , but more than # 8 million -LRB- $ 13.31 million -RRB- was paid in inheritance tax , leaving around # 13 million -LRB- $ 21.6 million -RRB- to be shared between Harry and his brother William , who is second in line to the throne , the British Press Association reported . 
Much of that money is thought to have been invested but it is not known if the economic downturn has affected the amount . 
Both princes are prevented from spending the lump sum of their inheritance until they turn 30 . But Harry will pocket all income generated by his portion of the estate -- around # 300,000 -LRB- $ 500,000 -RRB- a year . Watch more about Prince Harry 's birthday windfall ' 
Prince Harry joined the British Army in 2006 and served in Afghanistan for more than two months from the end of 2007 to early 2008 , before being withdrawn after news of his secret deployment leaked out to the media . 
There had been fears that Harry , who is third in line to the throne , could become a target for Taliban militants . 
According to British media reports , the prince 's deployment was subject to a news blackout deal struck between the Ministry of Defence and newspapers and broadcasters in the UK and abroad . 
He received a promotion to the rank of lieutenant in April last year and is now training to become a helicopter pilot with the British Army 's Air Corps . 
The young royal has also created a few negative headlines , particularly in Britain 's tabloid press , in recent years . 
In February this year , he was formally disciplined by his Army superiors after videos surfaced showing him using offensive language -- referring to a fellow soldier as a    Paki ' and another as looking    like a raghead . ' 
A spokesman for the prince told CNN :    Prince Harry has apologized for his comments and has been subjected to normal Army disciplinary procedures . The matter is now closed . ' 
In a well-publicized gaffe in 2005 , Harry apologized after he was photographed wearing a Nazi uniform at a party . 
   It was a very stupid thing to do and I 've learned my lesson , simple as that really , ' he said in an interview marking his 21st birthday .    I 'd like to put it in the past now . What 's done is done . I regret it . '
