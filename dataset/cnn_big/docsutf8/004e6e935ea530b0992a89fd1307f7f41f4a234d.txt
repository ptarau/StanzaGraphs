President Barack Obama signed an executive order Monday banning federal contractors from discriminating against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity . 
Despite calls from religious leaders , faith-based groups will not be exempt . 
   Thanks to your passion and advocacy and the irrefutable rightness of your cause , our government -- a government of the people , by the people and for the people -- will become just a little bit fairer , ' Obama said . 
Gay federal workers are already protected from workplace discrimination by a Clinton-era order and Obama 's action extended the protections to shield workers from gender identity-based discrimination . 
Americans United for Separation of Church and State , which joined a coalition of nearly 100 civil rights and LGBT groups urging Obama to reject calls for a religious exemption , thanked him for taking action . It said he made the    right call ' for not tagging any religious exemptions to the document . 
   Faith-based groups that tap the public purse should play by the same rules as everyone else and not expect special treatment , ' the group 's executive director , Rev. Barry Lynn , said in a statement .    No forms of discrimination should be supported with the taxpayer dime , period . ' 
Rea Carey , executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force , was in the room as Obama signed the order and said it was an emotional moment . 
   There are now millions of LGBT people and their families who are just going to sleep a little bit easier tonight knowing that they ca n't be fired from their jobs as federal contractors , ' she said . 
During the ceremony , which comes 50 years after President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , Obama also recalled the history of executive actions and legislation to ban discrimination in the workplace and    make sure we the people applies to all the people . ' 
Senate passes LGBT anti-discrimination bill 
But Obama 's signature on Monday did not touch a 2002 executive order signed by President George W. Bush that allows religious groups to weigh prospective employees  faith in hiring decisions . 
This gave some opponents of the order hope that they could continue to consider sexual orientation in hiring decisions . 
One of those opponents , Stephen Schneck , director of the Institute for Policy Research & Catholic Studies at The Catholic University of America , said he was disappointed by Obama 's decision regarding the religious exemption . But he suggested that religious groups could still rely on the 2002 order . 
   I believe the administration has left open a path that religious groups can work with , ' Schneck said . 
Russell Moore , president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention , had stronger words for Obama and worried that the Bush-era executive order would leave out some faith-based groups . 
   While we do n't know the full implications of this executive order , I am disappointed that this administration persistently violates the freedom of conscience for religious organizations that provide necessary relief for the poor and endangered , ' Moore said .    The ones hurt will be the most vulnerable in our society . ' 
Obama 's executive action extends protections against sexual-based discrimination to employees of federal contractors operating outside of the 21 states and the District of Columbia that enacted their own non-discrimination legislation . 
Obama also noted that a majority of Fortune 500 companies have policies in place against discrimination based on sexual orientation . 
The action is not the first time Obama has used his presidential powers to benefit the LGBT community . In 2010 , he signed an order extending benefits to same-sex partners of executive branch employees already provided to opposite-sex partners . 
But on the federal legislative level , LGBT groups have struggled to enact similar legislation . 
The Senate passed a bill barring LGBT discrimination in the fall . But the measure , which exempted religious groups from the would-be-law , did not make it to the House floor where Republicans opposed it . 
And attendees greeted Obama 's call to continue applying pressure to    resolve this problem once and for all ' with one resounding word :    Amen . '
