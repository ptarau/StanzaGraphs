The Western Australian government caught 172 sharks , and killed 50 of the largest animals , as part of a culling program that has sparked anger among conservationists . 
The three-month program , which ended last week , used baited lines attached to floating drums to catch sharks off popular beaches in Western Australia following a spate of fatal shark attacks in waters off the state in recent years . 
The scheme , which was part of the state 's $ 20 million shark mitigation policy , allowed for tiger , bull and great white sharks measuring longer than 10 feet -LRB- 3 meters -RRB- hooked on the drum lines to be destroyed . 
Some 50 tiger sharks longer than 10 feet were killed between January 25 and April 30 . The largest one , which measured 14.8 feet -LRB- 4.5 meters -RRB- , was caught in February off Perth 's Floreat beach . 
Not the right culprits ? 
But none of the creatures captured were great white sharks , the species believed to be responsible for most of the recent fatal attacks in Western Australia , which have left seven people dead in the past three years . 
Under the program , another 14 sharks measuring less than 10 feet died on the drum line and four more were destroyed because they were too weak to survive , according to the government 's figures published Wednesday . 
Western Australia 's Fisheries Minister Ken Baston hailed the shark mitigation policy a success , saying it was restoring confidence among beachgoers and contributing to research about shark behavior . 
   The human toll from shark attacks in recent years has been too high , ' Baston said in a statement released to the media . 
   While of course we will never know if any of the sharks caught would have harmed a person , this government will always place greatest value on human life , ' the minister said . 
Conservationist 's nightmare 
But the scheme has been criticized by environmentalists who say the sea predators should remain protected species . 
   Of the 172 sharks that were caught on the drum line , the majority were tiger sharks which have n't been involved in shark fatalities for decades in Western Australia , ' Sea Shepherd shark campaigner Natalie Banks told CNN . 
More than 70 % of the creatures caught on the drum line were n't large enough to be considered a threat or were other animals , like stingrays , Banks said . 
While monitoring the government program , Sea Shepherd found that sharks released alive were in a    state of shock ' known as tonic immobility and sank to the ocean floor , she said . 
Hi-tech initiative 
As part of its shark research and protection policy , the Western Australian Department of Fisheries is working on a satellite-linked shark tagging program that allows beach safety authorities to know , through near real-time alerts , if a tagged shark is in the vicinity . 
Under the three-month cull scheme , 90 sharks were tagged before being released alive . Other animals caught on the line were freed , including seven stingrays and a north-west blowfish . 
Beach closures due to shark sightings were also down this year , according to government figures . There were 93 closures in 2013-14 , compared to 131 the previous season . 
The Western Australian government is seeking approval to extend the program for three more years .
