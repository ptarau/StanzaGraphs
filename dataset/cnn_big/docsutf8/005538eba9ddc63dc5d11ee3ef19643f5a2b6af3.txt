-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Could search crews be just a few hundred feet from solving a mystery that has riveted millions for 76 years ? 
That 's the question raised by tantalizing evidence published this week by teams trying to find out what happened to famed aviator Amelia Earhart , who vanished along with navigator Fred Noonan during a doomed attempt to fly around the world in 1937 . 
Yet that evidence has been met with skepticism in some quarters . 
Debate about the mystery gained new currency this week after researchers publicized images recorded by search teams scanning the ocean floor nearly a year ago near Nikumaroro Island in the South Pacific . 
The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery raised the prospect of a big break in the case by publishing an image online . It showed something -- hard for the layman to size up -- on the ocean floor . 
The group said ,    It 's the right size , it 's the right shape and it 's in the right place . ' 
Could it really be a piece of Earhart 's Lockheed Electra plane ? 
Louise Foudray , caretaker and historian of the Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum in Atchison , Kansas , chose her words carefully on Friday afternoon . 
   We do n't want to shrug off the hard work anyone is doing . We do like the idea that people are still interested , ' she said .    But we 're skeptical . ' 
Opinion : Will mystery of Earhart be solved ? 
She said there have been other theories that have emerged . One is that Earhart 's plane was forced down by the Japanese around the Marshall Islands . Another is that Earhart secretly returned to the United States and the government gave her a new identity . 
There are people out there who buy those theories . But in reality , Foudray said ,    no one has yet to come up with anything conclusive . ' 
It was n't until March that one analyst made a possible connection to Earhart in an online forum for the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery . 
The group said experts have offered various interpretations . Some think the sonar image could be a man-made object , and others say it could be a geologic feature . 
Earhart : The evidence we almost lost 
   So did -LRB- last summer 's -RRB- expedition actually succeed in locating the wreckage of the world 's most famous missing airplane ? Or is this sonar target just a coral rock or ridge ? ' the organization says on its website .    Of course we 're not going to know until we can get back out there , but until then the anomaly is worth close study . ' 
Richard Fredricks , executive director of the American Salvage Association , a trade group , said that    almost anything is possible ' these days with advanced technology . And that includes locating a lost airplane . 
He cited technology such as side-scan sonar and magnetometers but said finding a lost plane such as the Earhart craft is    more a function of funding than technology . ' Money is needed to invest in expeditions , he said . The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery on its website is asking for contributions to continue its work . 
Foudray said she 's heard all of the evidence and nothing solid has risen to the surface . And that includes the latest foray into the South Pacific deep . 
   We do n't expect anything , ' she said .
