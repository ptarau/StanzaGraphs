Educator Ben Chavis says money is n't enough to improve schools run by incompetent administrators . 
-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Teachers unions and politicians are constantly claiming that K-12 public schools need more money in order to produce good academic results . But does the data support the argument that our schools need more money to succeed ? 
The Oakland Unified School District had a budget of $ 602 million for the 2008-2009 school year , according to Katy Murphy , an education reporter with the Oakland Tribune . That budget , which includes $ 77 million spent on consultants , means that the district spends an average of $ 16,270 per student ! 
What have we , the public taxpayers , received for our exceptionally generous financial support of the Oakland public schools ? According to the California Department of Education , the district 's reported 2008 California Standardized Test scores show : 
1 . Of 707 eighth - and ninth-graders who took the California Standard test for general math : 1 percent tested advanced , 5 percent tested proficient and 94 percent failed by testing below grade level . See details about K-12 schools , teachers ' 
2 . Of 2,506 ninth - and 10th-grade students who took the California Standards test in algebra : 0 percent tested advanced , 3 percent tested proficient and 97 percent failed the test . 
How is it possible for a public school system to so liberally spend more than half a billion dollars and still fail to educate 94 percent or more students of all racial backgrounds ? Does anyone believe providing more money to these public school systems will enhance these students  academic performance in mathematics ? 
During my principalship at American Indian Public Charter School , we spent less than $ 8,000 per student , proving that schools did not need more money . We served a student population that is on average 98 percent minority , with 97 percent receiving free or reduced-price lunch and many who are non-English speakers and from single-parent families . AIPCS students spend three to four hours a day working on mathematics and English-language arts . 
In 2009 , they excelled in academics , physical fitness and any standardized test that they were given . The hard work of these students and staff has paid off with virtually all of our eighth-graders testing advanced in algebra , including 100 percent of our eighth-grade black students , Mexican-American students and American Indian students . 
Before I became its principal , people called American Indian Public Charter School the zoo . The neighbors hated it . They could n't stand the behavior of the students , who , with little supervision or control , wreaked havoc in the area . 
Unfortunately , the students who decided to attend the school did not receive the academics and structure they so direly needed . The school was in many ways a failure , a joke , a sham . 
When I took over as principal in 2000 , it was the worst middle school in Oakland . I told the board I would take the job only if they let me go my own way and do what I thought was best . I implemented a golden rule at American Indian Public Charter School for staff , students and families : If you act like a winner , you 'll be treated like a winner . If you act like a fool , you 'll be treated like a fool . The charter school is now one of the top-scoring schools in the state and is nationally recognized . 
The United States spends more money on public education than any other country in the world . Yet , we still have a secondary public education system that ranks with Third World countries in preparing our children in English-language arts , mathematics , science and social studies . 
Washington , D.C. ; Detroit , Michigan ; Los Angeles , California ; Kansas City , Missouri ; and numerous other cities throughout the United States are producing the same poor academic results at an extraordinary cost to the taxpayer and a tremendous academic loss to our students and country . 
I believe all the money in the world would not be enough to improve schools run by incompetent public school administrators . We need proven leaders who can prepare our children to be competitive members in a free-market society . 
The American public has been conned into believing that public schools need more money . Have you ever met a public school administrator who said they have enough money ? 
President Obama is moving in the    right ' direction by reforming public schools to be held responsible to the American public in return for more money . It 's very clear that most Americans want to ensure that accountability be attached to the stimulus money that is being awarded to all institutions , including public schools . 
Next time you hear school officials or politicians begging for more money , ask them how large the district 's budget is and how many students are enrolled in their district . Then you do the math . After all , it 's your money they want to take .
