-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The phenomenal success of    Modern Family ' has been a game changer for its entire cast , including actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson . 
The show 's high ratings , three consecutive Emmy wins for outstanding comedy series and broad fan base have given all its stars a massive platform . Ferguson is using his for a cause that 's both political and personal : the fight to legalize same-sex marriage . 
The 37-year-old Montana native does n't just play Mitch , a gay man in a loving , committed relationship on TV ; in a way , he is Mitch . After dating for more than two years , Ferguson and his boyfriend , Justin Mikita , decided to take the next step . During a recent trip to Mexico , Ferguson    popped the big Q. ' Mikita said yes . 
After much consideration and debate , the newly engaged couple decided to go public with their private news , not because they do n't enjoy their privacy -- they certainly do -- but because in doing so they knew they could shine a light on a cause dear to their hearts . 
Ferguson and Mitka started the Tie the Knot foundation . Its mission is simple : sell bow ties to raise money for marriage equality . The    Modern Family ' actor recently spoke with CNN about his organization . 
CNN : When you go to www.tietheknot.org , the first thing you see is a hilarious video of you and Justin announcing your engagement . 
Jesse Tyler Fergusson : I feel like when you tackle any subject with comedy , humor and wits , you 're going to get a lot further than if you just give the dry facts of the cause . 
CNN : It definitely gets your attention . It could n't have been an easy decision to put your private life out there like that . 
Ferguson : We kind of felt like the only way to legitimize why we wanted to do this was to announce that we were actually engaged . It made me very nervous ; I did n't want to exploit something that was very personal and private between Justin and me . But , in the context of our foundation , it felt like -LRB- it was -RRB- the right time to tell people . 
CNN : My favorite part was your struggle with labeling your relationship . 
Ferguson : I hate    lover ' ! I think it sounds so pretentious and like that    Saturday Night Live ' skit with Will Ferrell and Rachel Dratch in the hot tub eating turkey . I 've always found the term fiance in gay or straight relationships to be completely strange . It does n't sound English or American at all . I love calling Justin    the lover I 've taken on , ' but he does n't care for that . So I just say    boyfriend . ' I think there 's something really sweet and innocent about it . 
CNN : A lot of boyfriends , and girlfriends in Maine , Maryland and Washington got some good news on Election Day when same-sex marriage was legalized in those states by popular vote . 
Ferguson : I have such mixed feelings about it . Obviously , I 'm so happy these states won marriage equality . It 's also very tough for me . I went through it with Proposition 8 -LRB- in California -RRB- , seeing the majority vote on the minority 's rights . It 's incredibly hard to swallow . I just feel like it should n't be up to the majority to vote on a minority 's civil rights . 
I 'm thrilled that we are slowly making progress , and we have to make progress however we can . But I do look forward to the day we stop putting it in the hands of the states and make it a national thing . This is America and -LRB- marriage equality -RRB- should be part of the    United ' part of our country . 
CNN : What do you see as the biggest challenge between where things are now and the protection of same-sex marriage under federal law ? 
Ferguson : We 're in a great place . There 's a forward movement on this issue , and for many young Americans it 's a nonissue . But one stumbling block is the lack of education about marriage equality . 
I feel like there 's a fear that the definition of marriage will be changed . Nobody 's looking to change the meaning of what it means to be married . We just want to add to who has the right . It 's the same thing as women wanting the right to vote . They were n't going to change the meaning of going to the polls and putting the card in the ballot ; they just wanted the right to vote . 
CNN : And whether you 're voting or getting married , who does n't like to wear a nice bow tie , right ? Why did you pick this accessory as the cornerstone of your foundation ? 
Ferguson : I selfishly wanted to get involved in the fashion world anyway , but in a way that did n't feel like a huge undertaking . So I thought about what I like to wear and also what is literally the smallest piece of clothing I could possibly design . So we came up with the bow-tie line . It was Justin 's idea to incorporate it into the foundation . We thought -- why do n't we kill two birds with one stone ? We 'll start a bow-tie line and funnel the proceeds into a foundation for marriage equality . Then Justin came up with the idea of Tie the Knot , which just perfectly marries those two ideas . 
CNN : I think people will appreciate the symbolism . Also , it matches your character in    Modern Family . ' I imagine your cast mates have been supportive . The chemistry there really seems to go beyond the set . Is that the case ? 
Ferguson : I mean it really is . People are always trying to test us and break us and find out the darkness , but there 's really nothing to tell . We 're kind of on this roller coaster together , and it 's a very bonding experience . 
We 're watching our families grow . I 've gotten engaged since meeting these people . Ty -LRB- Burell -RRB- has had two kids . Julie -LRB- Bowen -RRB- had twins . Sofia -LRB- Vergara -RRB- got engaged . We 'll go to a birthday party or get together at someone 's house and bring our husbands , wives , fiances , boyfriends and girlfriends , and it feels like a huge extended family . 
CNN : I bet when one of your family members finds themselves at the center of a crazy headline or serious crisis you all react . Do you turn into Papa Bear ? 
Ferguson : There 's obviously some sense of protection because we know being -LRB- in -RRB- the media 's eye how vulnerable that can be when you 're going through something . So we all rally around one another and protect one another . We 're always checking in with one another , and some walls definitely go up to protect some people . It 's exactly what you would expect from people who have your back . 
CNN : I can only imagine what a    Modern Family ' gay wedding will be like . I bet you and Justin get asked a lot when the big day is . 
Ferguson : About once a day ! We 're in the process of planning it . It could be as early as this spring , and it could be the following spring . We 're kind of waiting for some pieces to fall into place and to see what my work schedule is like next summer . I 'm also really excited to be married . I do n't want to have a three-year engagement . I proposed to Justin because I wanted to be married . I do n't want to be a professional engaged person . 
CNN : Are you planning something more traditional or , dare I say , modern ? 
Ferguson : Well , we 're not going to be redefining the marriage ceremony . I grew up Catholic but do n't practice any longer . I have n't been to the Catholic Church in years so I would feel really weird to try and bring in those traditions -- it 's just not us . It 's going to be a very nontraditional , very organic , very simple ceremony . We 're not going to have a wedding party or try to find someone amazing to officiate . I think it will be a very short , very sweet and simple and hopefully beautiful ceremony . I do n't even have any gay friends who have gotten married , but several of my straight friends had very untraditional weddings , and those have always been my favorite . 
CNN : Have you decided about starting a family ? 
Ferguson : It 's something we 've talked about . It 's one of those early date questions .    Do you want kids ? ' And we both do . But I 'm just excited to get married and sit in the marriage place for a little while . I do n't want to jump into kids right away . But , yeah , we both really want kids very much .
