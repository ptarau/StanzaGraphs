-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rock singer Sammy Hagar , a little older since his Van Halen days but still featuring bountiful blond curls , touted single moms , family and sex Monday night on the premiere of HLN 's    Dr. Drew . ' 
But for Van Halen fans , Hagar 's memories of the band and how he would like to regain a friendship with Eddie Van Halen may have been the biggest draw . 
   The greatest part of my musical career was being in Van Halen , ' said Hagar , who described to Dr. Drew Pinsky the alcoholism in his father and former bandmates . 
One of the band members , Hagar said , went into rehab and got clean , but    Eddie keeps falling down and would be in denial . ' 
Hagar , 63 , claims Eddie Van Halen , who he says is doing better these days , is perhaps jealous of his success since leaving the band , a power hard rock mainstay of the 1980s and 1990s . 
   They threw me out of the band , and they have n't done anything since 18 years later , ' said Hagar , author of a bestseller    Red : My Uncensored Life in Rock . ' 
   He 's got the biggest heart in the world , ' Hagar said of Eddie Van Halen .
