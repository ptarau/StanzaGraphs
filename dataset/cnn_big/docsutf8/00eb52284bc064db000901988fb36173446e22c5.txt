-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rapper and reality TV star Flavor Flav pleaded guilty to misdemeanor domestic violence charges in Las Vegas Monday . 
The plea deal allows the Public Enemy hype man to avoid a trial on felony charges , which could have sent him to prison for several years . 
Instead , Flav -- real name William Jonathan Drayton Jr. -- must stay out of trouble during a year of probation and attend 12 domestic counseling sessions with his longtime girlfriend 's teenage son . 
He was arrested after an argument involving a kitchen knife in his Las Vegas home in October 2012 . Flav , 55 , was initially charged with child abuse , assault with a deadly weapon and battery domestic violence . 
Las Vegas prosecutors agreed to reduce the charges to two misdemeanors counts , including attempted battery with substantial bodily harm and battery constituting domestic violence , according to Tess Driver , spokeswoman for the Clark County , Nevada , district attorney . 
Along with the year of probation and counseling requirement , he was given credit for the time he served in jail after he was arrested and before he was released on bond , Driver said . 
Although he gained fame with the groundbreaking rap group Public Enemy starting in the late 1980s , Flav , with his collection of clock necklaces , became a reality TV star over the last decade . He began as a cast member of VH1 's    Surreal Life ' in 2004 , which spawned    Strange Love ' in 2005 and three seasons of    Flavor of Love ' from 2006 to 2008 .
