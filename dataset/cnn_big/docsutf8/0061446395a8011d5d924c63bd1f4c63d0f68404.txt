-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner was told to take a month off work after doctors diagnosed her with a subdural hematoma . 
The diagnosis and the doctor 's recommendation mean Fernandez will be out of commission during the critical campaign season for congressional elections on October 27 . 
Spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said Saturday the president will suspend all her activities . 
A subdural hematoma is a blood clot on the brain 's surface beneath its outer covering , called the dura . Often , in people over 60 , a brain trauma can cause the blood vessels in the brain to tear , and blood to clot . 
In August , Fernandez , 60 , suffered a cranial trauma , for which doctors conducted a brain scan and found normal results with no symptoms at the time , Scoccimarro said . 
Doctors at a Buenos Aires hospital discovered the hematoma on Saturday after a neurological evaluation , he said . 
According to Argentina 's constitution , the vice president would assume the presidency temporarily in the president 's absence , but officials have not said if that will occur in this situation . 
Fernandez 's health made headlines when she underwent surgery in January 2012 to remove her thyroid , after doctors said they detected cancer in the gland . 
A few days later , a spokesman for Fernandez said she did not actually have cancer and that doctors had discarded their original diagnosis .
