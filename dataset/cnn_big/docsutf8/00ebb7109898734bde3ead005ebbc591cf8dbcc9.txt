-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Nebraska    hate crime ' that targeted an openly gay woman and that triggered responses from candlelight vigils locally to Facebook postings of support nationwide was staged by the alleged victim , authorities said Tuesday as they charged the woman with lying to police . 
Charlie Rogers -- a former basketball player for the University of Nebraska who identifies herself as lesbian -- told police that three masked men entered her home on July 22 , stripped her , tied her down , and carved homophobic slurs into her body before attempting to set her and the house on fire . 
But the Lincoln Police Department said Tuesday that    the physical evidence conflicted with Charlie Rogers  version of events ' and that    extensive investigation revealed numerous inconsistencies . '

Rogers was arrested Tuesday , police said . 
Her attorney , Brett McArthur , told CNN Tuesday night that Rogers had agreed as part of an arrangement to turn herself in , in exchange for a personal recognizance bond . 
   She did not have to post any money ' to be released , McArthur said , adding that his client pleaded not guilty to the charge of lying to police . 
   She maintains her innocence . This has been kind of a kick in the gut as a victim to turn around and be charged , ' McArthur said . 
In a news release , police cited DNA and pathologists  examinations that did not substantiate Rogers  original statements , and changes in her story during the investigation . 
   These were serious allegations that garnered national attention and spread fear among local citizens , ' the police statement said .    A great deal of time and resources were spent investigating Charlie Rogers  claims in hopes of identifying and arresting the three suspects in this case . ' 
Beth Rigatuso , president of Heartland Pride based in Omaha , organized a vigil that attracted over 1,000 people in the aftermath of the reported attack . 
For her , the news that it may have been a hoax is    a pretty big blow . ' 
   I do n't feel betrayed as much as I feel sad for how , if this is really true ... there is a lot of things going on with her , ' Rigatuso said .    It leads to a bigger problem in our society that someone would do this . ' 
Rigatuso said she hopes people would not turn their backs on Rogers now . 
The vigil she put together in Omaha raised more than $ 1,800 , all of which was deposited in an account for Rogers . 
   We 'd like to get the funds returned to us so we can establish our own fund to support victims of anti-gay violence . ' Rigatuso said Tuesday . 
McArthur , Rogers  attorney , said he    knows nothing ' about the fund or how much money might be in it . He said it was in place before he became Rogers  lawyer . 
According to the Lincoln Police Department complaint , Rogers , 33 , provided information    she knew to be false ' with the intent to    instigate an investigation of an alleged criminal matter . ' 
Rogers reported to police that she was lying on her bed when the alleged attackers held her down and carved    derogatory words ' into her arms and abdomen and    a cross ' in her chest . She told police she was then rolled onto her stomach where more cuts were made . 
But according to a deposition from Lincoln police investigator Lynette Russell filed as part of the complaint , Rogers bedspread was    evenly placed on the bed and no apparent sign of a struggle . ' A DNA lab test found no evidence of blood on the bedspread . 
Russell also described a pair of white gloves found at the scene that Rogers had said were not hers . 
   Ms. Rogers DNA profile was the major contributor to the DNA located on the inside of the gloves , ' Russell said . 
Furthermore , the deposition said , the FBI sent photos of Rogers  cuts to a forensic pathologist , who believed the wounds to be self-inflicted . 
   This opinion is based partially on the fact that the cuts appeared superficial and symmetrical , avoided sensitive areas of the body , ... are accessible to the victim and follow the victim 's frame of reference for reading and writing , ' the deposition said . 
Rumors had been circulating in recent weeks in Lincoln and on the Internet due to the fact that police had yet to pinpoint any suspects . The urge to respond to rumors prompted Rogers to give her one and only interview . 
   For people to think this does n't happen here , it does , ' Rogers told CNN affiliate KETV on July 27 .    It did . ' 
She refused to discuss the incident itself during that interview . 
Rogers  attorney at the time , Megan Mikolajczyk , told CNN her client was ready for a full interview early last week , but canceled saying    things have changed . ' 
Mikolajczyk said Tuesday that she is no longer Rogers  attorney . 
According to neighbor Linda Rappl , Rogers  showed up on her doorstep bloodied in the early morning hours immediately following the alleged attack last month . 
   I was in shock , ' Rappl said soon after the incident .    She was naked , her hands were tied with zip ties . All I could see was a cut across her forehead and blood running down . ' 
Rappl said she took the sobbing Rogers inside and wrapped her in a blanket before calling 911 .
