HARARE , Zimbabwe -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Zimbabwean lawmakers on Monday narrowly voted for Lovemore Moyo as speaker of the parliament -- making him the first opposition lawmaker to hold the position in the country 's history . 
Morgan Tsvangirai 's MDC faction has a slim majority following parliamentary elections . 
   This is historic as it ceases to be a rubber-stamping house , ' Moyo said after winning the position .    It will ensure that progressive laws are passed . I promise to be professional . ' 
Moyo -- the national chairman of the main Movement for Democratic Change -LRB- MDC -RRB- party -- received 110 votes while his only opponent , Paul Themba-Nyathi , received 98 votes . The speaker of the parliament is the fourth most powerful post in Zimbabwe . 
Themba-Nyathi represented the splinter MDC faction led by Arthur Mutambara , but he had support of President Robert Mugabe 's ZANU-PF party . 
The vote took place hours after Mugabe swore in lawmakers , five months after they were elected . 
Two members of the main MDC -- led by presidential candidate Morgan Tsvangirai -- were arrested as they arrived at the opening session , but they were released after a short time , according to a government spokesman . 
An MDC official said the arrests were part of the    sinister agenda of this regime ' to    tilt the balance of numbers in their favour during the voting for the speaker of parliament . ' 
One of those detained -- Shuwa Mudiwa -- appeared back in parliament , but the other member -- Elia Jembere -- was not seen , according to sources . 
Government spokesman Bright Matonga said Jembere had been accused of rape , but that he has been released from custody . 
A third member -- Elton Mangoma -- escaped an arrest attempt when other party members came to his rescue , MDC officials said . 
Attendance at the session of parliament is important since the membership is closely divided between the MDC and the Mugabe 's ZANU-PF . 
The ruling ZANU-PF party lost its majority in the 210-seat parliament in elections in March , but vote recounts and political violence have delayed the body from convening until now . 
Final results gave 100 seats to an MDC faction led by Morgan Tsvangirai , the party 's presidential candidate . President Robert Mugabe 's ZANU-PF got 99 seats . An offshoot of the main MDC party , led by Arthur Mutambara , won 10 seats . An independent candidate won one seat . 
Tsvangirai , who was locked in a bitter presidential contest with Mugabe , had objected to Mugabe 's decision to convene parliament , saying it could    decapitate ' power-sharing talks that have been on hold for the past two weeks . 
Still , Tsvangirai said he would attend the swearing-in ceremony . 
MDC party spokesman Nelson Chamisa said all MDC members elected to parliament were expected to attend    except those few MPs who are still in hiding . '
