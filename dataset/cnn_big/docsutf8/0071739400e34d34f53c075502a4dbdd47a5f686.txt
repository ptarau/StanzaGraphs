WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Russian military aircraft flew just 500 feet over two U.S. Navy ships this week as the ships participated in a joint military exercise with South Korea in the Sea of Japan , according to U.S. military officials . 
Two Russian Ilyushin IL-38 maritime patrol aircraft flew only 500 feet above a U.S. aircraft carrier . 
On Monday , two Russian Ilyushin IL-38 maritime patrol aircraft , known as    Mays , ' overflew the U.S. aircraft carrier Stennis while it was in international waters in the Sea of Japan . 
The Russian aircraft flew about 500 feet over the ship , lower than other flights the Russians have made over U.S. ships in the past year . 
The USS Stennis was about 80 miles east of Pohang , South Korea , participating in the joint military exercise when the flyover occurred . 
On Tuesday , the USS Blue Ridge , a lead command and control ship , and the Stennis were overflown by two Russian    Bear ' long-range bombers multiple times , according to U.S. military officials . 
The Bears overflew the ships at about 2,000 feet , officials said . 
U.S. military officials said that in both cases , U.S. Navy F/A -18 fighters met up with the Russian aircraft about 70 nautical miles from the U.S. ships and flew alongside them until they left the area . 
On both days , U.S. aircraft tried contacting the Russian planes on international air frequency radio channels , but the Russian pilots did not respond , officials said . 
The last time Russian planes flew over a U.S. Navy ship was February 2008 , when two Bears flew 2,000 feet over the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz south of Japan . 
Russian long-range flights skirting U.S. or other nations  boundaries have also been common over the last year . 
Although the Pentagon does not often talk about the overflights , there is nothing illegal about the actions , and they are generally seen by the United States as nothing more than muscle-flexing by the Russian military .
