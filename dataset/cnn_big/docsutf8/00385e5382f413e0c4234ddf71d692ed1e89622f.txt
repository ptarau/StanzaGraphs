-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Wise men say to look before you leap . In Alaska , it 's advisable to look before you land . 
That 's because , in Alaska , where seaplanes are common , you just might land on a whale . 
Last week in tiny , remote Angoon , Thomas Hamm was shooting video of a seaplane coming in for a landing . 
It was a mundane scene in the island community that 's only accessible by boat or seaplane . 
The video starts out normal . But as the plane lowers , it 's clear something is different about this approach . 
   All the sudden , the pilot advanced the throttle and I did n't know why . I thought ,   Oh something must be wrong ,  ' Hamm told CNN . 
That something was a whale , a humpback , swimming just under the surface . 
For a moment , it appeared the whale and plane would collide . 
But the pilot pulled up , getting just enough lift to avoid the mammal . 
The plane landed safely seconds later . 
Later Hamm showed the pilot the video he shot . 
Hamm said the pilot told him he did n't notice the whale ; he reacted to the commotion on the shore . Guys were pointing and yelling . 
Right as the pilot pulled up , the whale breached , clearing his blowhole and drenching the plane 's windshield . 
That 's one way to make a splash .
