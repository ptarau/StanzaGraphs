ISTANBUL , Turkey -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's a common sight in the traffic-clogged streets of Istanbul , a city that straddles two continents . 
Workers next to the spot where subway trains will one day emerge from the tunnel . Opening of the tunnel has been delayed by at least four years by the discovery .

For decades Istanbul has been growing at a breakneck speed ; its population exceeding -- by some estimates -- 15 million people . Too bad traffic often moves at a snail 's pace . 
Most residents are quick to tell visitors the city 's transport system is overwhelmed . 
   Istanbul is a dynamically changing city , every year increasing in population , ' says Zeynep Buket , an engineer working with Turkey 's transportation ministry .    We are in need of radical systems , and this radical system is a mass transit system . ' 
The    radical system ' city planners embarked on five years ago involved construction of a new subway tunnel beneath the Bosphorus Strait , the spectacular body of water that cuts this city in two . By the year 2025 , engineers predict more than one million people a day will use the tunnel to travel between Istanbul 's Asian and European shores . 
   We will connect two continents , Asia and Europe , ' said Nusret Ilbay , one of the many engineers working on the $ 3 billion Marmaray Tunnel Project . He was standing on scaffolding , overlooking a gaping 30-meter deep hole that will one day be a subway station on the Asian side of the Bosphorus . A concrete wall is all that holds back a churning river of sea water . Watch video of the tunnel being constructed 
   As you can see , some leakage on the wall face has been observed , ' Ilbay explained on a tour of the construction site .    In order to overcome these leakages , we have applied chemical grouting . ' 
Legend has it , thousands of years ago Jason and the Argonauts narrowly escaped death sailing up the Bosphorus in search of the mythological Golden Fleece . 
Today , engineers face equally daunting challenges building a tunnel beneath one of the world 's busiest shipping channels , at depths of up to 55 meters , in an active earthquake zone . 
First they dredged a trench on the bottom of the Bosphorus . Then , using divers and undersea cameras , they submerged and buried 11 massive pre-fabricated tunnel segments , almost all of them longer than a football field . 
To enter the unfinished tunnel , visitors must climb down a steep staircase in a construction tower surrounded by water in the middle of the strait . During the descent , the temperature plummets and humidity rises . 
Construction workers toil here in the gloom of this 1.4 kilometer long tube on the bottom of the sea , their welding torches spraying showers of sparks in the darkness . 
One worker claimed that during the lunch break , when the machinery came to a stop , he could hear the sound of oil tanker and cargo ships  engines as they motored past in the waters overhead . 
As a precaution in the event of a catastrophic flood in the tunnel , engineers constructed an emergency bunker on the bottom of the sea . Stocked with food and water and equipped with a heavy water-proof door , the    emergency room ' is supposed to protect survivors for up to 10 days , until they can be rescued . 
But , in their rush to modernize Istanbul 's transport system , city planners ran into an unforeseen obstacle : history . 
In Yenikapi , a neighborhood of textile factories and seedy hotels where one of the main transit stations for Istanbul 's new subway and commuter rail system was to be built , archaeologists discovered the lost Byzantine port of Theodosius . 
It was originally built at the end of the 4th century AD by Emperor Theodosius I when Istanbul -- then known as Constantinople -- was the capital of the eastern Roman Empire . The port 's harbor silted over centuries ago , and eventually disappeared beneath subsequent layers of civilization . Until its rediscovery in 2004 , archaeologists said they only knew about the port from ancient books . 
   This was a big moment of joy and happiness for us , an unexplainable feeling , ' recalls Professor Zeynep Kiziltan , the acting director of Istanbul 's Archaeology Museum . Look at pictures of the excavation ' 
   At around one meter below sea level , we started finding the remains of ropes . As we continued -LSB- digging -RSB- a bit more , the remains of a boat surfaced . ' 
Since that discovery , armies of hundreds of laborers and archaeologists have been working in a giant pit , three shifts a day , seven days a week . The scale of the excavation is unusual in modern-day archaeology , says Cemal Pulak , an anthropologist from Texas A&M University 's nautical archaeology program . Look at a map of the site 
   Its mind-boggling ... it really looks like an Indiana Jones-type operation , ' says Pulak , who has worked as a consultant on the excavation of the lost port . 
The Yenikapi dig has uncovered an ancient armada : 34 Byzantine ships ranging from dating between the 7th and 11th centuries AD . 
In one tent , two workers carefully uncover the ancient wooden beams of a 40-meter long merchant vessel . A third man preserves the wood by keeping it moist , sprinkling the relics with water from a hose . 
Archaeologists have nicknamed this ship    The Titanic , ' because it is the largest of the Theodosius wrecks . It is believed the vessel once carried wheat from Egypt to Constantinople . Scattered around the ship are shards of pottery , animal bones , and thousand-year-old clamshells . 
Historians say the new discoveries include the first examples of ships being built using the beginnings of the    skeleton approach ' to constructing the vessel 's hull . Pulak says that marked a revolutionary change which transformed shipbuilding from    mostly an art form to a science . ' 
   The earlier methods of building depended on verbal transference of the method from master shipbuilders to apprentices , ' he explained .    The development of the latter method ... allowed for the speedy communication of new shipbuilding ideas that could be transmitted on paper . It is the beginning of engineering . Ships could be preconceived and pre-designed . ' 
   I think it is one of the unique projects not only for us but for the world , ' said geologist Yucel Yilmaz . 
In addition to finding the timbers of thousand-year-old jetties and docks , which still jut up in straight rows at the bottom of the mammoth pit , archaeologists have uncovered the remnants of a pre-historic human settlement . 
   The first man , about 8,400 years ago , came and started to settle here , ' Yilmaz said .    There was no Bosphorus -LSB- then -RSB- . The Bosphorus was a river valley ... the people who settled here walked across the Bosphorus . ' 
Plans to travel beneath the Bosphorus have been delayed at least four years by the excavation of the Theodosious Port . The postponement has added untold millions of dollars have also been added to the cost of the entire project . 
In the rush to move forward , the residents of Istanbul have accidentally uncovered a valuable piece of their city 's ancient past .
