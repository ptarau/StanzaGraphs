London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Whatever the literary merits of J.K. Rowling 's new novel , the Harry Potter author is unlikely to earn many plaudits for the originality of her subject matter .

With a plot examining social tensions and class divisions between the rich and poor residents of an English village ,    The Casual Vacancy ' is a modern take on themes that have provided fertile inspiration for dramatists , novelists and satirists of English manners since at least the 17th century . 
Muggle moms await first adult J.K. Rowling book 
   We 're a phenomenally snobby society and it 's such a rich seam , ' Rowling said in an interview with The Guardian newspaper by way of explanation , in words that might as well have been attributed to Jane Austen , George Eliot , Joanna Trollope or any number of other female British writers .    The middle class is so funny , it 's the class I know best , and it 's the class where you find the most pretension . ' 
Still , Rowling clearly has an authorial eye for the preoccupations of her middle-brow audience . Britain can sometimes feel like a country in the midst of a permanent , low-intensity class war in which all targets are fair game and all are left feeling routinely persecuted . 
While the wealthy and privileged are derided as snobs and    toffs , ' members of the working class are grotesquely parodied and vilified as illiterate    chavs ' and the middle class is roundly mocked , often from within its own fragmented ranks , for its petit bourgeois obsessions with house prices , farmers  markets and amateur dramatics . 
Julian Fellowes , the script writer behind lavish Emmy-nominated period saga    Downton Abbey ' complained last year that    poshism ' was the    last acceptable form of prejudice ' , while Benedict Cumberbatch , the well-heeled star of    Sherlock ' said last month he had contemplated relocating his career to the U.S. because    posh-bashing ' in the UK had gone too far . 
At the opposite extreme , Owen Jones , the author of    Chavs : The Demonization of the Working Class , ' argued that the widespread blaming of last year 's riots in London and other cities on a supposed feral underclass was    classic demonization , reducing complex social problems to supposed individual failings and behavioral faults .

Class , swearing and sex fill J.K. Rowling 's first adult book 
If Rowling needed any further evidence of the enduring power of issues of class and status to raise British heckles , it came last week in the blundering form of Andrew Mitchell , a senior member of Prime Minister David Cameron 's cabinet , whose job as chief whip is still in the balance over whether or not , during an altercation with a policeman , he called the officer a    pleb ' and suggested that he ought to    learn his f ****** place . ' 
For critics of Cameron 's government , Mitchell 's alleged insult and the fact that , like the Eton-educated prime minister and many of his colleagues , he attended one of the UK 's elite fee-paying public schools appeared to offer further proof of a blue-blooded conspiracy to keep the proles firmly in their place . 
As Kevin Maguire wrote in the Mirror newspaper :    In Mitchell 's angry flash of social superiority ... we glimpsed the naked prejudice of the posh boys sitting at the cabinet table . The mask slipped to reveal how voters , the great British public , are viewed as inferior creatures , drones expected to know their place and tug a forelock at Conservative rulers in their government castle . ' 
Yet there are good reasons , aside from unvarnished prejudice , why class remains such a potent political issue . For those worst affected by the present government 's austerity program , portrayed by opponents as an ideologically motivated assault on the founding principles of Britain 's welfare state , the    We 're all in it together ' mantra coined by British Finance Minister George Osborne -- the heir to a baronetcy and a multimillion dollar wallpaper fortune -- understandably rings hollow . 
Class remains the single most important factor in shaping the life prospects of every single person born in Britain ; a fact most glaringly illustrated in terms of life expectancy itself , with men in the most deprived areas of the Scottish city of Glasgow typically dying at 71 , while those in London 's wealthy enclave of Kensington and Chelsea can expect to live beyond 85 . 
Time : We read   The Casual Vacancy ,  here 's what we think 
At the heart of the British class structure still sits the English public school , the best known archetype of which is now probably Rowling 's own Hogwarts -- a place of arcane rituals and Latin lessons , bunk-bedded boarding houses and Gothic grandeur . 
Real-life public schools may not offer lessons in magic and wizardry , but they do equip the offspring of those willing to cough up annual fees of tens of thousands of dollars with access to a world of privileged connections and a fast track via a well-oiled    old boys  network ' into lucrative and successful careers in the upper echelons of politics , government , the military , the judiciary , banking and business . 
About 7 % of English pupils attend fee-paying schools yet alumni of the top 100 public schools make up almost one third of annual admissions to Oxford and Cambridge -- universities whose own peculiar traditions owe more to their archaic ties to those institutions than to the rigors of a modern , egalitarian education system . 
Opinion : J.K. Rowling 's daring leap 
Former public schoolboys even punch above their weight on our screens , with two of Britain 's leading actors -- Damian Lewis , an Emmy winner this week for his starring role in    Homeland ' , and Dominic West , celebrated for his portrayal of a rough-edged Irish-American detective in    The Wire ' -- both also alumni of Eton . 
It remains to be seen whether Rowling has anything novel to add to the class debate , but one thing of which she is undoubtedly aware is that it is a subject that will shift copies from the shelves in droves . 
As    Downton Abbey ' and the entire careers of Hugh Grant and Richard Curtis have demonstrated there remains an insatiable appetite beyond British shores for the sort of cut-glass accents , excruciating social awkwardness and polite self-effacement that the country has turned into a thriving export industry . 
Rowling , famously canny businesswoman that she is , will surely already have negotiated movie rights to a story that will be lapped up as eagerly across the Atlantic .
