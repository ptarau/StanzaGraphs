-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For decades , skyscrapers have served as iconic symbols of national pride or flashy trophies of corporate wealth , reshaping the skyline of the world 's major urban centers . Perhaps in the future , the high-rise superstructures could also help revolutionize the way we travel . 
That , at least , is the fanciful concept behind the Vertical Hyper-Speed Train Hub , a futuristic proposal of two UK-based architects envisaging trains roaring up and down the side of specially-designed skyscrapers nearly as high as the Empire State Building . 
Towering above the crowded streets of future metropolises , these giant buildings are designed to minimize the large slices of real estate that major railway terminals occupy by flipping them on their side . 
The goal , designers Christopher Christophi and Lucas Mazarrasa say , is to free up valuable space in the densely-packed cities of tomorrow , which will be significantly challenged by overcrowding and a sharp drop in public space availability . 
   In 60 years  time , it will be very difficult for governments to find attractive pieces of available land for public use in the heart of megacities , ' says Christophi , 27 .    Governments will be able to take advantage of such spaces in order to re-adapt the cities  structure to society needs , ' he adds . 
How it works 
The designer 's vertical station concept calls for a tall cylindrical skyscraper whose small footprint would allow the transformation of the surrounding area into an urban park . Passengers arriving at the tower would use a lift to make their way up into the platform and from there into their carriage , which could accommodate 10 people sat in two rows opposite each other . 
But , you might wonder by now , how could commuters stay on their feet whilst the train slides in hyper speeds along the huge tower 's faÃ § ade ? 
The main idea is that instead of traveling on normal rails beneath , the carriages would be supported by magnetic tracks running up the skyscraper 's exterior . Each carriage proportion is designed as a cubical shape to enable it to function both vertically , when docked , and horizontally , while traveling After the train 's departure , the wagons would pivot like a    Ferris wheel , ' allowing commuters to remain in an upright position and enjoy breathtaking views of the city . 
Connecting cities 
The radical proposal won the designers an Honorable Mention at this year 's eVolo Skyscraper competition , which encouraged people from around the world to propose new ideas for vertical structures of the future . 
The designers say the towers , which would be capped off by a rooftop green plaza , are envisioned as individual pieces of infrastructure that could be replicated in cities around the world . 
The hope is to connect a new hyper-speed network of underground tunnels and overground routes where superfast trains would cover distances of 300 miles in 30 minutes . This , they claim , would not only save commuting time and simplify the way public transport is being used , but would also help to cut down CO2 emissions by replacing ways of transport powered by fossil fuels . 
   Our conceptual design is based upon utilizing existing and viable technologies that can currently be seen in hyper speed rail networks , for example in China , ' says Mazarrasa , 29 , adding that is a matter of time before we 're able to reach the rail speeds their concept requires . 
   The Maglev trains currently travel at 360 miles per hour -- this technology by the 2075 will in no doubt move leaps and bounds from what it already is today , making the hyper-speed trains probably the fastest and safest way of transporting goods and people . ' 
Of course , there are a number of limitations to the project -- the proposal deals only with stations designed to accommodate city by city travel , not to mention efficiency issues around loading trains in high volume terminals and connecting train routes . 
Yet , like in most futuristic transport proposals , practical details are best to take a back seat for now to allow us to enjoy the thrilling ride -- that is , unless you 're afraid of heights .
