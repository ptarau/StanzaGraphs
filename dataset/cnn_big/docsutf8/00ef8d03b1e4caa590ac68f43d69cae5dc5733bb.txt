-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Scores of people who had been without bread for days were killed when Syrian warplanes bombed a bakery in the western village of Halfaya , opposition activists said Sunday . 
More than 100 people were killed , the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said . The death toll could rise , the activist group said . 
An activist who oversaw the burial of many bodies said at least 109 people died . 
Hassan Al-Rajb told CNN that 69 people were identified and buried , while 15 others were laid to rest without being ID 'd . At least 25 more bodies were still at the site , but hospital workers said the roads were cut off and they were unable to reach the bakery , he said . 
The hospitals can not handle all the wounded , he said . 
An LCC activist told CNN he went to the scene . 
   There were dozens of dead thrown in the street . The residents were shocked and in a state of fear . It was chaotic , ' Mahmoud Alawy said . 
Videos posted on social media purported to show the aftermath of the attack . Many bodies had limbs apparently blown off , and others lay bloody in the streets and in rubble strewn over a sidewalk . Uniformed Free Syrian Army soldiers and civilians scramble to pull survivors out of the carnage . 
CNN can not independently confirm government or opposition reports out of Syria , as the government has restricted access by journalists . 
The town has lacked the ingredients for bread for about a week until an aid group delivered provisions Saturday , Alawy said . Hundreds of people lined up at the bakery on Sunday . 
Al-Rajb said the town has three bakeries , and one opened at 1 p.m. Workers began to distribute the bread two hours later . He was on his roof about 200 meters -LRB- about 219 yards -RRB- from the bakery about 4 p.m. and saw a plane overhead . He scrambled toward the scene when he heard cries of    Emergency ! Emergency ! ' he said . 
   The first floor collapsed on the second floor , and four rockets were fired into it , ' he said of the attack . 
Alawy claimed the government has been targeting large gatherings of people with artillery shells in the recent days since the Free Syrian Army liberated the town from Syrian forces . 
About an hour after the bakery attack , 15 shells were fired into Halfaya from a nearby town , Al-Rajb said . 
The Hama Revolution Command Council , a network of activists affiliated with the FSA in Hama province , said a MiG warplane bombed the bakery .
