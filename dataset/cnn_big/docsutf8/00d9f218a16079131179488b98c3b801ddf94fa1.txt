Call them drones ; call them toy airplanes with digital cameras dropped into their girths . 
Either way , South Korean defense officials said on Friday they were sure that they came from North Korea and that they were up to no good . 
Three diminutive single-engine unmanned propeller planes that look like they could have come from a hobby shop were found on the ground in March and April in parts of the South near the border with the northern Communist regime . 
Though the low-tech buzzers do n't seem to represent a major danger , they come in the shadow of North Korean missile launches and the impending countdown to the test of a nuclear device . 
And they made it through South Korean air defenses . 
Ministry of National Defense officials in Seoul immediately suspected that the sky-blue colored fliers belonged to Pyongyang . They formed an investigation team with the United States in mid-April to analyze the    travel log file ' and photos taken by the drones and announced the results on Friday . 
Scientists found a    smoking gun that all three were sent from North Korea and are programmed to return to North Korea , ' South Korean defense spokesman Kim Min-soek said . 
Photos the drones took along on their journey corroborate their flight path , he said . 
Precarious cargo 
Had the mechanical carrier pigeons made it back home , they would have delivered precarious cargo , but it would have been far from precious . 
Japanese-made digital cameras , which look like they could be of the consumer variety , were inserted into the bellies of the drones and had taken aerial photos of the South from around the border region . 
All three were programmed to fly over military facilities , and two of them had images of targets of military interest -- strategically important islands near the demilitarized zone , and the Blue House , residence and office of South Korea 's President Park Geun-hye . 
Images from the third drone were not available to South Korean investigators . A wild ginseng digger had stumbled upon the plane and had deleted its memory card so he could use it himself , the Korea Times reported . 
The planes were not capable of transmitting images back to North Korea in real time , and the photos themselves were no better than what one might see on a service akin to Google Earth , Kim said in a previous briefing . 
Limited capabilities 
There is little danger the drones could have made it far into South Korea . 
The type of drone is not used for long-range missions , a defense analyst said . Instead they 're better suited to see what the enemy is up to on the other side of a hill or wall . 
   It has quite a small range , it does n't have very long endurance so it would only be up there for a few hours . You would use those to see what the other guys are doing in a battlefield environment , ' said James Hardy , the Asia Pacific editor of IHS Jane 's Defence Weekly magazine . 
   They 're very much closely built off a remote-controlled aircraft that you can buy in a toy store . They 're just a militarized version of that , ' Hardy said . 
The Korean drones are nowhere near as sophisticated as those used by the United States in Pakistan , Yemen and Afghanistan , he said . 
They would also not make much of a weapon , if someone decided to stuff explosives into them , Kim has said . 
   Even if they are to be used for future attacks , -LRB- they -RRB- can only carry 2-3 kilograms of TNT and can not cause huge damage . ' 
North Korea has flaunted similar , larger UAVs at military parades in recent years , and some of them have been spiked with explosives , Hardy said . 
Video footage shows North Korean exercises using them as missiles , but it 's an expensive way to build a bomb , he said . And it could only take out a single vehicle or ship . 
'T is the season 
Spring is traditionally a time of high tensions between Pyongyang on the one side and Seoul and Washington on the other . 
Annual U.S.-South Korean joint military drills , that ended on April 7 , drew criticism from North Korea , which views the exercises as    dress rehearsals for invasion , ' according to analyst James Person from the Woodrow Wilson Center . 
In March , Pyongyang fired two mid-range ballistics missiles off its eastern coast , in an apparent response to the drills . Days later , the two sides fired hundreds of shells across the Northern Limit Line , their disputed maritime border . 
The shells were shot into the sea , not at hard targets . 
North Korea also warned it was preparing to test another nuclear device . 
   It 's all good stuff because it allows the North Koreans to do something provocative and slightly annoying which might embarrass South Koreans , but it 's not provocative enough to create a proper military response , ' Hardy said . 
Slipping through 
The drones would fit well into that category , since they slipped through South Korean air defenses . 
They are made of polycarbonate , which is difficult to detect with radar , according to South Korea 's Yonhap news agency . 
They fly at an average speed of about 110 km per hour -LRB- 68 mph -RRB- at an altitude of 1.3 km -LRB- .8 miles -RRB- . 
They were launched in North Korea from three locations , South Korea 's defense ministry said : Near the Kaesong area , 27 kilometers southeast of Haeju and 17 kilometers from Pyonggak . 
South Korea 's defense ministry called the intrusion by the drones a violation of the truce that ended the bloody conflict between North and South Korea in 1953 . 
Kim said Seoul will send a warning via the United Nations to Pyongyang and tighten air defenses as a response to the drones .
