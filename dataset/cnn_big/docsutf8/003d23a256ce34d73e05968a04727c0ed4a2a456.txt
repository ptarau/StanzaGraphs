-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Airport hotels have always been necessary but unloved stopover spots for the depleted traveler , places to shower , rehydrate and let the body recuperate from the merciless rigors of flying . 
Yet checking into the Hilton Frankfurt Airport , which opened in December turned out to be much more . It 's an example of the emerging generation of airport hotels that are intended to function as destinations , real places where one might reasonably stay longer than a single night . 
Some of the best and most spectacular airport hotels are in Asia : the Regal in Hong Kong ; the Crowne Plaza in Singapore . Now the rest of the world is catching up , and the newest airport hotels in Europe , the United States , Latin America , and elsewhere are responding to the generalized craving for experience . And there 's more going on than that : the increasing sophistication of these hotels parallels a reemergence of civilization -- daring architecture ; edible food -- in airports themselves .
