-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The small , World War II-era plane that crashed Friday during a Reno , Nevada , air race was equipped with data and video recording devices that investigators hope to use to help determine what happened and why . 
Seven people , including the pilot , were killed when the plane crashed into spectators at the race , with two others later dying at area hospitals . Close to 70 people were injured . 
National Transportation Safety Board member Mark Rosekind on Sunday described this realization , as well as the discovery of information and pieces that may have come from the devices , as    significant new information . ' It was also not entirely expected , given the size and nature of the P-51 aircraft . 
   I 'm not aware of a lot of aircraft having it , this is the first one I came across , ' said Howard Plagens , who is the NTSB official heading the investigation . 
Plagens was referring to a    box ' that recorded key variables such as altitude , latitude and oil pressure . In addition , there was an outward-facing video camera on the plane , according to Rosekind . 
Several memory cards have been found at the wreckage site that may have come from either device , and will be sent to the NTSB laboratory in Washington , D.C. , for a full analysis , Rosekind said . They may belong to some of the 200,000 spectators then at the annual National Championship Air Races and Air Show . 
Investigators do have a copy of the    box ' data , since it was sent in real time by telemetry to sources outside the aircraft . 
Besides the cards , Rosekind said parts of a plane 's tail , an    elevator trim tab ' and video camera fragments have been found . 
   There were thousands of pieces of debris , ' Plagens said , explaining how the site had been laid out in a grid system to help organize the probe . 
As with the memory cards , one of the authorities  first goals will be to determine if these came from the plane being piloted by 74-year-old Jimmy Leeward . Countering earlier reports , Rosekind said on Sunday that Leeward did not send a    Mayday call , ' indicating he was in distress . 
Investigators have repeatedly stated that it is not now known why the aircraft nosedived . Some speculation has surrounded the elevator trim tab -- which was breaking apart prior to the crash , a photograph shows . 
Besides the plane 's trim tab , parts of a tail , the memory cards and already known plane data , investigators also will pore over    a tremendous -LRB- amount of -RRB- video that was captured ' at the scene , according to Rosekind . 
While a preliminary report will be available Friday , Rosekind has said the full investigation could take six to nine months . 
   It 's not just what happened , it 's why it happened , ' he said Sunday . ' -LRB- We 're -RRB- trying to make sure this does n't happen again . ' 
Meanwhile , the crash 's toll became clearer Sunday as more of those killed were identified . 
Besides Leeward , the dead include Michael Joseph Wogan , a 22-year-old from Phoenix who was attending the event with his father as part of a father-and-son vacation , his family said in a statement . His father , William , was    seriously injured , ' the statement said . 
Wogan was diagnosed at an early age with muscular dystrophy , and was wheelchair-bound his entire life . However , his 19-year-old brother James Wogan said in the family statement ,    He was about moving past that and always driven toward independence . Michael liked to get out and travel , and he was so excited about getting on a plane as part of this trip . ' 
Michael Wogan graduated magna cum laude from Arizona State University with a finance degree in May , his family said . He had operated a web development company and was in the process of developing a second business . 
Memorial service details were pending , the statement said . 
Also identified Sunday were George and Wendy Hewitt , members of Cascade EAA Warbirds Squadron 2 . The Hewitts were killed when the plane crashed into the seating area , said R.D. Williams , a spokesman for the squadron . 
According to its website , the squadron aims to    promote and encourage the preservation and operation of World War II and other such aircraft that are representative of military aviation operations ' along with educating people on safely operating and maintaining such aircraft . The plane that crashed Friday -- dubbed the    Galloping Ghost ' -- was one such plane dating from that era . 
Several witnesses have portrayed Leeward -- a real estate developer from Ocala , Florida -- as a hero because he appeared to manuever the plane away from the crowded grandstands at the last moment . 
He went down around 4:15 p.m. PT Friday while taking part in a qualifying round in the    unlimited class ' division of the air race , said Mike Draper , the show spokesman . The final rounds , which had been slated for the weekend , were cancelled . 
   This is the first time in 40 years , I think , that we 've had a visitor injured or killed , ' Reno Mayor Bob Cashell told reporters Saturday .    We 've lost some pilots , but we 've never had a major catastrophe . ' 
One local hospital , Renown Medical Center , received 34 patients , four of whom were in critical condition as of Sunday afternoon . Two patients -- a male and a female -- died , the hospital said Friday . 
Dr. Mike Morkin , the medical director of emergency services at the hospital , was on duty when the call about the crash came in Friday . 
   The severity of this accident was the worst I 've seen since I 've been at Renown , ' Morkin , a 16-year veteran at the hospital , said . 
Renown South Meadows Medical Center received and discharged five patients , the hospital said Saturday . 
St. Mary 's Hospital in Reno said it had accepted 28 patients from the accident : As of Sunday afternoon , two were in critical condition and six in serious condition . The remainder have been released .
