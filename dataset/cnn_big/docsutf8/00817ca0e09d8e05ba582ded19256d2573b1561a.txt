-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mitchell Johnson was in danger of becoming the forgotten man of Australian cricket . Shunned by the selectors after an alarming loss of form , he spent a year out of the Test team as he struggled to overcome a foot injury . 
But the 31-year-old is back with a bang , having terrorized Sri Lanka 's batsmen to help the home side clinch a 2-0 series win in Melbourne on Friday . 
The left-arm paceman was named man of the match after claiming six wickets and scoring 92 not out as the tourists crumbled to defeat by an innings and 201 runs -- Sri Lanka 's third worst reverse in the five-day game . 
Johnson , only playing because of injuries to other bowlers , followed up his four-wicket haul from Sri Lanka 's first-innings 156 with a fiery spell that earned two more scalps and ended the tour of key batsman Kumar Sangakkara , who had scored 27 . 
Sangakkara , who on the opening day joined the elite club of players to have scored 10,000 Test runs , needs surgery on a broken finger after being hit on the gloves by Johnson -- who also gave wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene a hairline thumb fracture in the first innings . 
Neither Jayawardene nor bowler Chanaka Welegedara were able to bat due to injuries , and Sri Lanka collapsed to 103-7 all out in 24.2 overs . Two wickets fell in Johnson 's opening over of the innings , one of them a run out . 
   The plan through this Test match was to get up their batters and unfortunately for them they got a few injuries out of it , ' said Johnson , who passed the milestone of 200 wickets in his 49th Test . 
   I think that intimidation factor definitely worked out there today . We found a bit of a weakness with them with the short ball ... They obviously did n't handle it as well as they would have liked . ' 
It marked a minor career resurrection for Johnson , who was Australia 's main strike bowler until his form fell apart during the 2010-11 Ashes series against England . 
   In the time I 've had off I 've been able to reflect on a lot of things . I had probably got to the stage where I listened to a lot of outside influences -- that does n't affect me anymore . I 'm just happy with how I 've come back , and making the most of the opportunities I get , ' he said . 
   It 's not every day you get to play for your country , and I 'm pretty proud of the fact I 've played 49 Tests now . You 've just got to look to the future and , if you get picked , go out there and make the most of it . That 's what I 'm doing ... and playing with a smile on my face . 
   I 've always been happy playing for Australia , it just got to the point where I was feeling the pressure . It happens in professional sports , you can feel the pressure and start to believe in things that are said or outside influences , and it just got to that point for me . 
   I 've moved past that . I 'm 31 , I 've been around the game for a long time now and I think I 've matured in that I have belief in myself and just go out there and play my game and do the best job I can . ' 
Despite his heroics , Johnson is not guaranteed of starting the third Test in Sydney from January 3-7 . 
Mitchell Starc is expected to return after being rested , while debutant Jackson Bird made a strong impression as an opening bowler , taking two wickets in each innings . 
   His control with the new ball is an area that I think we 've been looking for , ' captain Michael Clarke said .    The one thing I really like about Jackson is you know what you 're going to get . 
   He bowled into the breeze the whole game and did a fantastic job for us . I think Birdy played a huge part in Mitch 's success in the first innings , and it allows a bowler like Mitch to be able to attack . ' 
Australia will be without key all-rounder Shane Watson , who has a calf injury , meaning Glenn Maxwell has the chance to make his Test debut after previous appearances in limited-overs internationals . 
Meanwhile , India leveled the Twenty20 series against Pakistan with an 11-run victory in the second match at Ahmedabad on Friday . 
The home side put on 192-5 after batting first , with Yuvraj Singh smashing 72 off 36 balls , sending seven deliveries over the boundary ropes . 
Pakistan could not follow up Tuesday 's five-wicket win in Bangalore , finishing on 181-7 after 20 overs . Ashok Dinda took 3-36 from his four overs . 
It is the first bilateral series between the neighboring countries in five years . The three-match one-day series will start on Sunday .
