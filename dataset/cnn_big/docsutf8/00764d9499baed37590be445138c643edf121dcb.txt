-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Attention white Anglo-Saxon Protestants : Your days of running things are over . You have jumped the shark . 
But there 's no need to feel bad for WASPs . 
They 've had an amazing run . Every single president in our nation 's history , except for John F. Kennedy -- a Catholic -- and Barack Obama , has been a white Protestant . Except for a handful of exceptions , for over 200 years the presidential nominees of both major political parties have been WASPs . WASPs had almost as many victories in a row as The Harlem Globetrotters . 
But it 's over . Look at this year 's presidential tickets : A Mormon , an African-American , and two Catholics . Even some of the keynote speakers at the Democratic and Republican conventions were not WASPs . The GOP featured Italian-Irish Catholic Chris Christie and the Democrats tapped Latino-American , Julian Castro . 
Times are so bleak for WASPs that there 's not a single one on the Supreme Court . Likewise , in Congress , the percentage of Protestants fell from 74 percent in 1961 to a slim majority of 55 percent today . Neither the current Speaker of the House -LRB- John Boehner : Catholic -RRB- nor the Senate majority leader -LRB- Harry Reid : Mormon -RRB- is WASP . 
I 'm sincerely not gloating . And my jibes are in jest . But what I 'm happy about is that our two major political parties are increasingly reflecting the new face of America . The demographics of our nation are changing and , by 2042 , minorities are expected to become the majority in the U.S. 
Objectively , the delegates at this year 's Democratic convention were far more diverse . The Republican convention looked more like the early bird dinner crowd at The Cracker Barrel . 
Opinion : In Ohio , candidates are salesmen trying to close the deal 
However , in the GOP 's defense , a party that is 90 % white , they have started to slowly showcase minorities , such as Sen. Marco Rubio and Govs. Nikki Haley and Bobby Jindal . They are well aware that if they do n't , the GOP will go the way of the Whigs . 
There 's little doubt that we will see more diverse presidential candidates . And we will likely see in the not too distant future a president who is Latino , Asian , Jewish , Sikh or Muslim . -LRB- That screaming sound you might have heard was Michele Bachmann shrieking in horror at the idea of a Muslim-American president . -RRB- 
This is a testament to our nation . We are by our very nature progressive . It may take years , or even decades , to see change , but we always march forward , not back . 
So , how did we get to where we are today where the white Protestant establishment seems to be losing power ? Well , it 's kind of complicated -LRB- as these things tend to be -RRB- . There are tons of reasons . But one important factor that has contributed to today 's political landscape is changing voting rights laws . 
Back in the days when our nation was founded , only white men who owned land could vote . That means rich white men with money get to control the political system . -LRB- I know some of you are thinking : How is that different than today ? -RRB- 
In our first presidential election in 1789 , no women , no blacks , no poor white men , and in many states neither Catholics nor Jews , were permitted to vote . 
Over time , some states abandoned the requirement of land ownership so that poor white men could vote . And the religious restrictions were also lifted so that non-Protestants were able to vote . 
Opinion : Democrats and Republicans need a plan to keep American dream alive 
However , it was n't until after 1870 , when the 15th Amendment was ratified , that black American citizens were finally guaranteed the right to vote . -LRB- Although poll taxes , literacy laws and other measures were still employed in some states to disenfranchise black voters . -RRB- 
And it took all the way to 1920 -- more than 100 years after our first president was elected -- that women were finally given the right to vote with the passage of the 19th Amendment to our Constitution . 
Enfranchising voters of all backgrounds has led to the opening up of our democratic process . Minorities no longer just voted -- they became active in politics . And they did n't just show up at political meetings -- over time they sought elective offices . And some of them won . With each success , they inspire even more minorities of every race , ethnicity and religion to become active in our political system . 
So WASPs , you 've had your great run . And there is no doubt that another white Protestant will rise up one day against the growing odds and win the White House . But until that day comes , you can console yourself knowing that a white Protestant male is one of the most exciting athletes in our nation today : Tim Tebow . -LRB- Of course , he is the back up to Mark Sanchez . -RRB-
