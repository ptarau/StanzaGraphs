It was April 18 , 1864 , and the Lincolns had planned to go to a fair in Baltimore , returning the next day . They needed someone to watch their 11-year-old son , Tad . 
A newly published letter from Mrs. Lincoln requesting a sitter gives rare insight into the family 's life inside the Lincoln White House , showing one way the family had to juggle their busy schedules , just like everyone else . 
The letter is being offered for sale by the Raab Collection , a dealer in historical documents , valued at $ 15,000 .

   Hon. Mr. Harrington , We would like to have the services of Charles from today , at 2 P.M. until tomorrow at 11 A.M. Very Resp . Mrs. Lincoln . ' 
   Charles ' was Charles Forbes , a Treasury Department employee who was detailed to the Lincolns and often served as the president 's valet , footman , messenger or attendant , according to the Raab Collection . 
George Harrington was assistant secretary of the Treasury and Forbes  boss and handled personal financial matters for the Lincolns .

Mary Todd Lincoln ended up not going to the Baltimore event , likely too burdened with preparations for a reception the next night , the final White House reception of the season , Raab says .

Forbes was seated outside the president 's box at Ford 's Theatre and was the one who allowed the assassin , John Wilkes Booth , to enter .
