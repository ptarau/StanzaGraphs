-LRB- Health.com -RRB- -- An essential nutrient found in fish oil does not appear to slow the mental decline associated with Alzheimer 's disease , according to a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association . 
The study is merely the latest to cast doubt on the mental benefits of the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid -LRB- DHA -RRB- , which until recently was considered a promising way to minimize the risk and damage of dementia . -LRB- The other main ingredient found in fish oil , eicosapentaenoic acid , or EPA , is not believed to play a significant role in brain health . -RRB-

DHA or fish-oil supplements are n't likely to cause any harm to Alzheimer 's patients , but they are n't likely to do any good either , says Steven H. Ferris , Ph.D. , the director of the Aging and Dementia Research Center at New York University . 
Fish oil    seems to be healthy in general , and maybe for other things it 's helpful , but it does n't benefit cognitive function in a person with Alzheimer 's , ' says Ferris , who was not involved in the study . 
Research on DHA has been inconclusive and sometimes conflicting . Several studies that followed large groups of people as they aged have suggested that a diet rich in fish is linked to a reduced risk of dementia and mental decline , but most randomized controlled trials comparing DHA supplements with placebo have found no benefit .

   It 's not the first time something in large epidemiological datasets just did n't work out clinically , ' Ferris says , noting that statin medications , anti-inflammatory drugs , and estrogen therapy have all failed to live up to their initial promise in preventing or treating Alzheimer 's .    Unfortunately , that seems to be the situation here . ' 
The study was funded by the National Institute on Aging and was led by Dr. Joseph F. Quinn , M.D. , a neurologist at the Oregon Health and Science University , in Portland . 
Quinn and his colleagues randomly assigned about 400 women and men in their mid-70s with likely Alzheimer 's disease -- the disease is very difficult to accurately diagnose -- to take 2 grams of DHA or placebo capsules per day . After 18 months , the average mental decline in the DHA and placebo groups was nearly identical , as measured on two separate tests and rating scales . 
Despite the disappointing results , the study does n't entirely rule out the possibility that DHA may have some benefit if taken earlier in life . A growing body of research suggests that dementia begins decades before any noticeable symptoms surface , and it 's possible that DHA helps prevent or slow those harmful changes .

Treatments such as DHA may be too little too late for people who are already showing signs of Alzheimer 's , according to Dr. Kristine Yaffe , M.D. , a professor of psychiatry at the University of California , San Francisco . 
   Effective treatment strategies to prevent progression of -LSB- Alzheimer 's disease -RSB- will likely need to be initiated earlier , ' Yaffe writes in an editorial accompanying the study .
