LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When Danish auteur Lars von Trier presented his gothic thriller ,    Antichrist ' at Cannes Film Festival last month , it was greeted with cat-calls , jeers and , at times , disbelieving laughter . 
Danish auteur Lars von Trier has been making films that shock , provoke and impress for over 40 years . 
Filmmakers are expected to give audiences a hard time at Cannes and the two-hander starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg as a couple grieving the loss of a child is no exception . 
But it was the level of pornographic sex and visceral brutality that outraged some and astonished many . 
Von Trier was labeled a woman-hater for the wince-inducingly horrific final scene in which female lead Charlotte Gainsbourg takes a pair of rusty scissors to her genitals and performs a DIY clitoridectomy right to camera . 
An Ecumenical Jury that normally hands out a prize at Cannes celebrating spiritual values felt moved to award    Antichrist ' an    anti-prize ' for being    the most misogynist movie from the self-proclaimed biggest director in the world . ' 
   Lars von Trier , we get it , ' wrote film critic Wendy Ide in UK paper The Times .    You really , really do n't like women . ' 
Misogyny could n't be further from the truth , according to Von Trier , who says he sees himself up there on the screen :    I mostly see myself as the female character , ' the 53-year-old director told CNN in Cannes .

The director says that he shot the film as a form of therapy after recovering from a serious mental illness . Indeed , a few years ago , it was questionable whether von Trier , who is famously multi-phobic , would be able to make another film . 
In the winter of 2006 , he fell victim to depression and checked into hospital , the aftermath of which left him    like a blank sheet of paper , ' he told Danish paper Politiken at the time . 
Today , if not fully recovered -- the most terrifying thing he can think of is still    myself ' -- he is able to function once more and is receiving cognitive behavioral therapy to help him face up to his psychological issues . 
Despite , or perhaps because of , what he describes as his    sensitive ' nature , von Trier is one of today 's great contemporary European auteurs , considered responsible for spearheading a revival in the fortunes of Scandinavian filmmaking . 
   I think that if you are , shall we say , sensitive , then there is a good side and a bad side about it , ' said von Trier .    The good side is that you can sometimes achieve something creatively . But , of course , it always also allows some of these negative thoughts in .

He has been nominated for the top prize at Cannes , the Palme D'Or , a staggering eight times , winning once in 2000 for the harrowing operatic tragedy ,    Dancer in the Dark , ' starring Icelandic musician , Bjork , who also took home the Best Actress prize that year . 
It is rumored Bjork became so unhinged filming    Dancer in the Dark ' she ate her own cardigan . Von Trier claimed each morning she would say    Mr von Trier , I despise you , ' and spit at him . In pictures : The wierd world of Lars von Trier ' 
Von Trier has a reputation for being tough on his actors . His friend and long-time collaborator , actor Stellan Skarsgard describes von Trier as    not uncomplex . ' 
   I was scared , ' admitted Gainsbourg who won Best Actress at Cannes for her performance .    I had heard stories about him as a director ... maybe he 's cruel and vicious . ' But she now describes him as her    guide ' and    the greatest director I 've ever worked with . ' 
Fueled by his unconventional approach and upbringing , the mythology surrounding von Trier looms large over everything he touches . 
Brought up in Copenhagen by bohemian parents who were committed nudists , he suffers from crippling bouts of agoraphobia ; and , most famously , a fear of flying . Each visit to Cannes involves a five-day road trip from Denmark to the French Riviera by camper van . 
He has an undeniable egotistical streak : this year at Cannes , he declared ,    I am the best filmmaker in the world , ' and in 1991 , when displeased that Cannes jury president Roman Polanski had only awarded    Europa ' the runner-up Grand Prix prize , he called him a    dwarf . ' 
He also seems to actively court controversy : 1998 Palme D'Or contender    Dogme # 2 : The Idiots ' grabbed headlines for being the first commercial film to show non-simulated sex on screen , and for von Trier 's typically eccentric claim that the best way to prepare actors for sex scenes is to direct in the nude . 
But , von Trier says , he has always taken a deeply personal approach to the experimental , often dark and challenging works that he creates . He says he finds it difficult to know how to satisfy the needs of others with his films and so works only for himself . 
   I feel very strongly for satisfying , maybe not my own needs , but my own idea of the film and the images that come from within , ' he told CNN . 
   If I did n't follow my instinct , then I ca n't work . '
