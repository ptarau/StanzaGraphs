-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An official in Inner Mongolia is disputing an Amnesty International report that parts of the region are under martial law . 
   We did not enforce martial law . Everything is normal , ' said Chao Lumen , an official with the information department of Xilingol prefecture . 
In the report released Friday , Amnesty International detailed protests in and around the city of Xilinhot , the prefecture 's seat of government . 
   Nothing happened here . There were no demonstrations or protests , ' Chao said Monday . 
The Amnesty report said Chinese authorities declared martial law in some parts of the autonomous region in an apparent response to days of protests . 
The region has long been the scene of ethnic tension between Mongolians , who have lived in the area for centuries , and the Han people , who arrived in larger numbers after the founding of the People 's Republic of China in 1949 . Han people are the majority ethnic group in China . 
According to the human rights organization , 2,000 Mongolian students took to the streets Wednesday in Xilinhot , in a show of solidarity with an ethnic Mongolian herder by the name of    Mergen , ' who was killed earlier this month when he was hit by a coal truck that was driven by ethnic Hans . 
Amnesty reported that the drivers of the coal truck are both in custody of Chinese authorities . 
In a clip posted to YouTube that purports to show that same demonstration , a large group of people , many of whom are young people wearing school uniforms , can be seen walking through the streets . 
The students were marching toward the building that houses the regional government , shouting ,    defend our land and defend our rights , according to the New York-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center . The group refers to the area as    southern ' -- not    inner ' -- Mongolia , and would like to see the region achieve independence or merge with Mongolia . 
CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the clip . 
According to Amnesty , the protests , which started May 23 , have been largely peaceful , but at least 18 people were reported injured in confrontations with police northeast of Xilinhot , in Right Ujimchin Banner , or Xi Wu Qi in Mandarin . 
   The protests are a wake-up call for the authorities . As in other minority areas , authorities must start heeding the message rather than attacking the messengers , ' said Catherine Baber , Amnesty 's Asia pacific deputy director . 
Protesters say their culture is under threat as pastoral herders are pushed out from the grasslands and forced to move to the cities , or to places where animal grazing is not possible , according to Enghebatu Togochog , Director of the Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center . 
He traces the motivation for recent demonstrations to the Chinese central government 's efforts , in recent years , to expand coal mining and production in areas that have traditionally been used for grazing .
