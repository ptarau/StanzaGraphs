Ballet dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko , often cast as the villain in Bolshoi Ballet productions , is now the lead defendant in a plot worthy of a Tchaikovsky score . 
The 29-year-old allegedly choreographed an attack intended to blind Bolshoi artistic director Sergei Filin , the man who put him in the roles of Ivan the Terrible and Swan Lake 's evil genius . 
The mystery of who threw sulfuric acid into Filin 's face in January has captivated Russians and kept Moscow detectives busy probing rivalries within Russia 's renowned 240-year-old ballet company . 
It might well send Hollywood literary agents and producers scrambling for story details as described by police reports and local media accounts . 
Police declared their case was solved this week with a confession by Dmitrichenko 
Russian police question suspect in Bolshoi director 's acid attack 
   I organized this attack but not to the extent that it happened , ' he is heard saying in a video released by police . 
The characters in this drama include Dmitrichenko 's girlfriend , Anzhelina Vorontsova . She has not been charged , but local newspapers quote ballet members as saying Dmitrichenko was angry because he thought Filin was stifling her career . 
Two alleged co-conspirators have been detained : Alleged hit man Yuri Zarutsky -- a burly , bearded Russian who was previously convicted of beating someone to death -- and Andrey Lipatov , who allegedly drove the getaway car after Zarutksy 's battery acid attack on Filin . 
While the final act must still play out in a Russian courtroom , the story opens in the nearly two-century-old Bolshoi Theatre . 
Act 1 - The Bolshoi Theatre 
Ballet is a world where competition is fierce , and where the artistic director wields considerable influence in making or breaking careers . 
Filin , 42 , was promoted to the Bolshoi Theatre 's coveted post in March 2011 , shortly after the deputy ballet director , Gennady Yanin , who was widely seen as a favorite for the artistic director post , resigned when pornographic pictures of him surfaced online . 
There was    fierce rivalry ' for the Bolshoi position at the time , according to the RIA Novosti news agency . 
That year , two dancers quit , unhappy with the direction the ballet had taken . 
Another dancer , Nikolai Tsiskaridze , loudly criticized Filin for going over budget in the ballet 's multimllion-dollar renovation . 
Tsiskaridze , incidentally , was also a contender for the artistic director job that Filin got . 
But beyond professional disagreements , sinister factors were also at play . 
Act 2 - The Streets of Moscow 
RIA Novosti reported that before the attack , Filin suffered months of intimidation , including threatening phone calls . 
Someone slashed his car tires . Somebody also attempted to hack his Facebook page . 
The trio of conspirators obtained battery acid at a car parts store , and made the acid stronger by evaporating the water from it , police said . 
Dmitrichenko , who studied Filin 's schedule , called Lipatov and Zarutsky when he saw Filin leave the theater on the cold night of January 17 , police said . 
As Filin entered the security code at the door of his Moscow apartment , authorities say , Zarutsky confronted him and tossed the sulfuric acid into his face . It caused third-degree burns and left him blinded . 
Act 3 - Moscow Police Headquarters 
Detectives pored over interviews with those who knew Filin and had suspicions about who would harm him . Other clues led them to several cell phones that Dmitrichenko had registered in other people 's names , according to a police statement . 
Calls from those phones led investigators to Lipatov , the alleged driver . 
   I did n't see what happened there , ' Lipatov told them in a video released by police .    I just took Yuri there , waited for him and gave him a lift back . ' 
When an interrogator asked Zarutsky about the crime , he allegedly said ,    I do n't want to talk about it . ' 
Police concluded a    hostile relationship ' stemming from Dmitrichenko 's professional interaction with Filin was his motive .

Act 4 - A Moscow Court 
The three men faced a judge Thursday , who ordered that they be kept in police custody until the investigation is over . 
If convicted , the attackers could face up to eight years in jail for willfully inflicting damage on the health of another . 
It may take at least six months for Filin to recover from the burns . 
In the meantime , Galina Stepanenko , a former principal dancer , will run the company . 
She says she 's going to follow Filin 's plans and she believes the dancers will now be united by greater respect and care for each other . 
Doctors performed a skin graft on Filin and , after a second eye surgery , they were able to save his sight . 
His colleagues are now working to ensure his artistic vision is n't lost .
