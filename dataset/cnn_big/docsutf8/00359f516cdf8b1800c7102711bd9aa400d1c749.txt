LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former detainees of Immigration and Customs Enforcement accuse the agency in a lawsuit of forcibly injecting them with psychotropic drugs while trying to shuttle them out of the country during their deportation . 
Raymond Soeoth , pictured here with his wife , says he was injected with drugs by ICE agents against his will . 
One of the drugs in question is the potent anti-psychotic drug Haldol , which is often used to treat schizophrenia or other mental illnesses . Doctors say they are required to see patients in person before such drugs are administered . 
Two immigrants , Raymond Soeoth of Indonesia and Amadou Diouf of Senegal in West Africa , told CNN they were injected with the drugs against their will . 
Both are plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the government . They are seeking an end to the alleged practice and unspecified damages . Watch why the former detainees claim abuse ' 
Dr. Paul Appelbaum , a professor of psychiatry , law and ethics at Columbia University , reviewed both men 's medical records for this report and was stunned by what he discovered . 
   I 'm really shocked to find out that the government has been using physicians and using potent medications in this way , ' said Appelbaum , who also serves as a member of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law . 
   That is the sort of thing that would be subject to a malpractice claim in the civilian world . ' 
The allegations of ICE forcibly drugging deportees were raised last month by Sen. Joe Lieberman , I-Connecticut , during the re-nomination hearing of ICE chief Julie Myers . 
   The information the committee has received from ICE regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling , particularly since it appears ICE may have violated its own detention standards , ' Lieberman spokeswoman Leslie Phillips told CNN in an e-mail . 
   Senator Lieberman intends to follow up with ICE to ensure that detainees are not drugged unless there is a medical reason to do so . ' 
ACLU attorney Ahilan Arulanantham , who is representing Soeoth and Diouf , said ,    It would be torture to give a powerful anti-psychotic drug to somebody who is n't even mentally ill . ... But here , it 's happening on U.S. soil to an immigrant the government is trying to deport . ' 
Responding to Lieberman 's written questions , Myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had    medical escorts ' for deportation since 2003 . 
From October last year to the end of April this year , she said 56 received psychotropic medications during the removal process . Of those , 33 detainees received medication    because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others and/or self , ' she said . 
   First , I am aware of , and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ICE detention standards , ' Myers said . 
She added no detainee should be    involuntarily medicated without court order , ' except in emergency situations . 
But both Soeoth and Diouf say they had not exhibited any combative behavior . 
Soeoth , a Christian minister from Indonesia , spent 27 months in detention awaiting deportation after his bid for political asylum was rejected . Hours before he was to be sent back home on December 7 , 2004 , he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him groggy for two days . See the document that shows Soeoth was injected 
   They pushed me on the bench , they opened my pants , and they just give me injection , ' he said through broken English . 
He says he was taken to Los Angeles International Airport while in this drug-induced stupor , but two hours before takeoff , airline security refused to transport him , so ICE agents returned him to his cell at Terminal Island near Los Angeles . Terminal Island , once a federal prison , is a crowded facility along the ocean where hundreds of illegal immigrants await deportation . 
Soeoth 's medical records indicate he was injected with Cogentin and Haldol , even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness . 
In the records , the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark Soeoth denies ever making . 
ICE said in a written statement it could n't respond to specific allegations due to pending litigation . 
   Department of Homeland Security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees , ' the ICE statement said .    Only trained and qualified medical professionals , including officers of the U.S. Public Health Service , may prescribe or administer medication . ' 
But , Diouf says , he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported . He said he even had a federal stay of his deportation -- and the paperwork to prove it -- but his U.S. government escorts would n't let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the country .

That 's when , he says ,    I was wrestled to the ground and injected through my clothes . ' 
A government report says he was medicated because he did not follow orders . 
In both cases , Diouf and Soeoth remain in the United States pending a decision in the case . If they lose , they may land back in the hands of ICE , once again facing deportation . 
Soeoth says he 's traumatized by what happened .    I know this country -LSB- is -RSB- very generous to immigrants , ' he says .    What they did to me was very , very bad . ' E-mail to a friend
