   At this stage it is too early to tell the severity of the earthquake in Haiti , but the early signs are not good with communications down across the country , ' said Jane Cocking , humanitarian director of Oxfam . 
Kristie van de Wetering , a former Oxfam employee based in the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince , said the situation in the capital was    very chaotic ' with many buildings reduced to rubble . 
   We can hear people calling for help from every corner . The aftershocks are ongoing and making people very nervous , ' she said . 
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said volunteers in Haiti were assisting the injured and supporting hospitals which had been overwhelmed by the disaster . 
It said it had enough supplies in Haiti for 3,000 families . Experts in disaster response are due to arrive in the country later Wednesday to coordinate international relief efforts , it said .

The quake struck about 15 km -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- southwest of Port-au-Prince shortly before 5 p.m. local time , cutting off communications across much of the country . 
   Port-au-Prince is devastated , lot of deaths . SOS . SOS ... , ' wrote Louise Ivers , the clinical director of medical charity Partners In Health , in an e-mail to the group 's offices in Boston , Massachusetts .

   I 'm calling on all friends of Haiti and people who are listening to me to please come to our aid , ' said Raymond Joseph , Haiti 's ambassador to the U.S. told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer by telephone . 
   Today as Haiti is going through the worst day in its history I am calling for all others who got help from us in the beginning to help in support , ' Joseph said .    The only thing I can do now is pray and hope for the best . ' 
Singer Wyclef Jean , nephew of ambassador Joseph , stressed the need for help for what is considered among the poorest nations in the Western Hemisphere . 
   We 're going to need immediate aid , ' Jean told Blitzer on CNN .    We 're going to need the United States and the international community to react immediately . ' He founded Yele Haiti , whose community service programs include food distribution and emergency relief . 
In Washington U.S. President Barack Obama said the government would    stand ready to assist the people of Haiti . ' 
At the Pentagon , the U.S. military said humanitarian aid was being prepared for shipping , but it was not yet clear where or how it would be sent . A U.S. aviation source said the control tower at the Port-au-Prince international airport collapsed , possibly hindering efforts to fly relief supplies into the country . 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters that Washington is offering    our full assistance ' to Haiti .    And our prayers are with the people who have suffered , their families and their loved ones , ' she said . The deputy chief of the U.S. mission in Haiti , David Lindwall , told Clinton that he saw    significant damage ' from the quake and said U.S. officials there expect    serious loss of life , ' Crowley said . 
And Clinton 's husband , former U.S. President Bill Clinton -- now the U.N. special envoy for Haiti -- said the world body was    committed to do whatever we can to assist the people of Haiti in their relief , rebuilding and recovery efforts . ' 
Haiti 's government is backed by a U.N. peacekeeping mission established after the ouster of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 2004 . 
The United States has been heavily involved in Haiti commercially , politically and militarily for most of the last century . U.S. intervention under Clinton restored Aristide to power in 1994 after a 1991 coup , and a U.S. jet hustled him out of the country again in 2004 following a rapidly spreading uprising against his government . 
With people stripping the trees for fuel and to clear land for agriculture , the mountainous countryside has been heavily deforested . That has led to severe erosion and left Haitians vulnerable to massive landslides when heavy rains fall . 
Roads in Haiti were unsafe to travel on because of a lack of lighting and because many buildings along transportation routes had collapsed or were not deemed safe , said Ian Rodgers of the relief organization Save the Children . 
   What I can hear is very distressed people , ' Rogers said .    There is a lot of distress and wailing of people trying to find loved ones . ' 
A representative for the aid group Catholic Relief Services in Haiti described the situation in the nation as    a total disaster , ' said Robyn Fieser , regional information officer for the group . 
Haiti 's dense population will increase the risk to its people , Jean said . The nation 's need for aid will range from water and food to medical and building supplies . 
   This is the worst devastation that we as Haitian people have faced , ' he said . 
Hurricane Gordon killed more than 1,000 people in 1994 , while Hurricane Georges killed more than 400 and destroyed the majority of the country 's crops in 1998 . And in 2004 , Hurricane Jeanne killed more than 3,000 people even as it passed north of Haiti , with most of the deaths in the northwestern city of Gonaives . 
Gonaives was hit heavily again in 2008 when four tropical systems passed through . 
According to the U.N. Office for the Special Envoy for Haiti , unemployment reaches 70 percent nationally , and 78 percent of Haitians live on less than $ 2 a day .
