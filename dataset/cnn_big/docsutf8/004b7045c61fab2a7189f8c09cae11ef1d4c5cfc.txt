-LRB- CNN -RRB- New York may be a paradise of Zagat-rated , Michelin-starred restaurants , but some of its best food can be found on the streets .

King of Falafel & Shawarma 
Halal carts slinging styrofoam plates piled high with falafel , shawarma and rice are ubiquitous in New York , but you 'll recognize    the King ' by the seemingly endless line crowding the sidewalk beside it . 
Originally a Queens staple , the cart dominated the corner of 30th Street and Broadway in Astoria for almost a decade before it won the Vendy Award for New York 's Best Street Food in 2010 . 
Now , its second cart in Midtown Manhattan peddles its famous falafel and shawarma to the masses , in addition to meaty plates like the Freddy 's Junior : chicken , kefta and basmati rice topped with chopped onion and doused liberally in tahini and chile sauce .

Dirty water dogs

Breakfast cart bagels

Many pre-prepare their bagels for convenience , but most carts will make your bagel to order . 
Coffee , usually deli-quality , is served in small blue-and-white Anthora cups that have become as characteristic of New York as yellow cabs and dirty water dogs .
