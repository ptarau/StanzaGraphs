-LRB- WIRED -RRB- -- Apple 's loose-lipped overseas partners are exchanging whispers about the next-generation iPad , claiming it will come in three different versions , one of which would work with Verizon 's network . 
The iPad 2 will support three different wireless configurations : UMTS , CDMA and Wi-Fi only , according to    industry sources quoted by DigiTimes ' citing component makers . 
That 's up from the two versions Apple currently offers : UMTS plus Wi-Fi , and Wi-Fi only . 
To explicate the alphabet soup , UMTS is the standard used by major 3G carriers such as AT&T and T-Mobile , while CDMA is compatible with Verizon and Sprint networks . 
Currently the 3G iPad ships with a MicroSIM card slot , and in the United States , the only carrier that uses MicroSIM is AT&T . 
Customers who want to connect to non-AT & T 3G networks must either buy an external wireless hotspot device such as the Verizon MiFi -LRB- Verizon already sells a MiFi plus iPad package -RRB- or trim a standard SIM card down to MicroSIM size , like Wired.com 's Charlie Sorrel . 
The current 3G model of the iPad is not tied to a contract : Customers pay a flat monthly rate for data and can opt out whenever they please . 
So if this rumor is true , it means that when the iPad 2 ships , you 'll have to pick a 3G model based on your carrier preference . If you do n't plan to be on the road a lot , there 's still the Wi-Fi option . 
Support for both major wireless standards in the United States will make the iPad 2 available to a much larger potential audience , whereas before it was only available in the states from AT&T . 
WIRED : With iPad , Apple still has fatal attraction for AT&T 
Whether Apple hammers out sales agreements with Verizon or Sprint remains to be seen . 
Recent rumors suggestion that the iPad 2 will hit stores April 2011 , one year after the original iPad 's release . Some third-party protective cases for a purported    iPad 23 have been cropping up in Asia , hinting at the possibility of a bigger speaker and a rear-facing camera . 
Persistent rumors -- so far unsubstantiated -- have also pointed to a Verizon-compatible iPhone to be released in early 2011 . 
If Verizon gets the iPhone and the iPad , it would greatly expand Apple 's potential market , and would also likely deal a severe blow to AT&T , which has been roundly criticized for the inability of its 3G network to keep up with iPhone-induced demand .
