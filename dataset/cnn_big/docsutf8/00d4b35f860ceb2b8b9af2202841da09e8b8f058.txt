He says it 's his last fight . And it 's been his hardest . 
After 43 years in Congress , New York Rep. Charlie Rangel said the campaign for his 23rd term is his final one . 
The 84-year-old    Lion of Harlem ' wants two more years in Washington , but on Tuesday , voters will decide if his time is up . 
He 's a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus , and the former chair of the powerful Ways and Means Committee . 
But the legend of Harlem politics is on shaky ground . 
Rangel running for 23rd term in the House 
Rangel says he 's ready this time 
He 's been bruised before . In the 2012 Democratic primary , victory came by a thin margin . Rangel beat state Sen. Adriano Espaillat by fewer than 1,100 votes . 
The congressman said he did n't put up much of a fight . 
   I did n't have a campaign last time . When he told me he was running I was in the hospital in Columbia Presbyterian with a viral infection in my spine . ' 
This time , Rangel said he 's ready . 
   Well , I do n't have a walker . I do n't have a spinal injury . ' 
Rangel has also had more time to recover from a humiliating censure in 2010 from the U.S. House of Representatives following a series of ethics violations . 
2014 midterms : What 's at stake 
Gearing up for Round 2 
Since 2012 , Espaillat has been gearing up for Round 2 . This time , the underdog said he 's counting on an upset and making comparisons to one of the biggest ones ever in boxing : 
   Sonny Liston was a big , bad bear when he got into the ring , but -LRB- Muhammad -RRB- Ali was faster , smarter than him , ' Espaillat said .    He was able to draw circles around him , and he shook up the world and he changed boxing . ' 
If voters want a change now , it may be a measure of how much the district has changed since Rangel went to Washington in 1971 . 
Harlem 's rich African-American history now seems distant 
Neal Schumacher knows the streets of Harlem as well as anyone . He gives walking tours , and he often points out the fact that the neighborhood is , ' ... not the Harlem that I grew up in , but a Harlem I embrace . ' 
A falling crime rate has accelerated real estate development in the neighborhood , but affordable housing remains among the most pressing issues for many with roots in the community . 
   People are concerned about gentrification , about rising housing costs , about some of the mom and pop shops closing . About being able to afford to live in the community where you are now , ' said Schumacher . 
Harlem has long been known for its rich African-American history . But to Harlem historian Jacob Morris , that past feels more distant today . 
   In the 20th century Harlem was incontrovertibly ... the cultural capital of Black America . ... Is it still ? I would say now it 's the custodian of that great history . ' 
Both say racial and ethnic politics not part of race 
Today , the demographics are different . So is the district itself . 
Part of the Bronx was added to Harlem 's district before the 2012 primary . The 13th Congressional District now has a Hispanic majority . 
If elected , Espaillat would become the country 's first Dominican-American congressman . 
Both candidates insist that racial and ethnic politics should n't determine the outcome of the race . 
   We never had a political battle in my congressional district in 43 years based on where you were born or what religion you have , ' Rangel said while campaigning Saturday . 
2014 midterms : Complete coverage 
Turnout could be key 
According to a NY1/Siena College poll released the week before the primary , the vast majority of voters said the race or ethnicity of the candidates makes no difference to them , 
The same poll shows Rangel has a 70-point lead with blacks and a 5-point lead with whites , while Espaillat has a 24-point lead with Latinos . Overall , the poll gives Rangel a 13-point lead -LRB- 47 % -34 % -RRB- against Espaillat . 
Insiders suggest the race is tighter than that and too tough to predict . 
A key factor : turnout is expected to be low . Both campaigns will have to battle to get voters to the polls on Tuesday . The congressional race is the only item on the ballot .
