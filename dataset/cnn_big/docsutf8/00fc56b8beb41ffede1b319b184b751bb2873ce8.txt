-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Dutch court intervened Friday to stop a 13-year-old girl from attempting to sail around the world by herself , stripping her parents of sole custody . 
Laura Dekker will find out on Friday whether the Dutch Court will back her record attempt . 
Laura Dekker 's parents support her round-the-world ambition , which sparked concern from child protection officials because of her age . They took the case to court to prevent the solo trip . 
On Friday the Dutch High Court in Utrecht ruled that the Child Protection Board will share custody over Laura with her parents for two months . 
The move prevents the parents from permitting Laura to set off on her trip alone , though Laura will remain at home with her father , Dick Dekker , a court official said . 
During those two months , a child psychologist will assess Laura 's mental state and ability to carry out a solo round-the-world journey , a court official said . A guardian will be appointed to oversee the case until the court next meets Oct. 26 . 
The court will then make a final ruling on whether her parents may have the final say about their daughter 's plans , the court official said . Is the court right to block her bid ? Have your say below 
Laura 's parents are happy about Friday 's decision , family lawyer Peter de Lange said . He said the parents are especially pleased that the court did n't prevent Laura from making the journey , because they hope she can still proceed with her plans . 
The teenager was out sailing Friday , de Lange said . She is pleased with the decision and hopes she can still make a solo trip , he said . 
Laura believes she will be able to convince the court that she is fit to make the trip alone , de Lange said . 
Social workers took the action to stop the teen from attempting to become the youngest person to circumnavigate the globe because they believe the voyage would be too dangerous . 
Laura said she has dreamed of sailing around the world since she was 10 and her parents are determined to help her achieve her goal . She called the attention that has been heaped on her case    a bit over the top . ' 
Just this week , a British teenager became the youngest person to sail around the world solo when he returned to Britain after a nine-month trip . Guinness World Records confirmed the feat . 
Mike Perham , 17 , had a support team sailing alongside him during the trip . He said he does n't think age alone should determine whether Laura Dekker is ready for such an adventure . It 's    whether she 's got the physical strength , the mental strength , or the technical ability , ' he said .    Can she strip an engine blindfolded ? Can she build boats ? Is she an electrician ? Is she a mechanic as well ? You ca n't just be a sailor for a trip like this . ' 
Another sailor , Robin Knox-Johnston , also said age should n't be the only determining factor . He was the first person to circumnavigate the globe alone without stopping -- in 1969 , when he was 29 . 
   It 's really more a question , is that person , that young person , mature enough to be able to look after themselves and deal with everything that 's going to come at you when you get out alone at sea ? ' he said . 
Gold medal-winning Olympic sailor Shirley Robertson insisted that sailing is an experience-based sport and that Laura may not be ready for such a great challenge . 
   Mike Perham has four years on Laura . That 's a big difference , ' she told CNN . 
   Mike had already completed challenges such as sailing across the Atlantic before embarking on his ultimate quest . 
   There 's a world of difference between sailing a small craft on the Ijsselmeer and sailing around the world with all the challenges that presents . ' 
Robertson also pointed out that    we live in a culture of record-breaking and fame-seeking , ' with people constantly looking to be the youngest or quickest at anything . 
   Why does she need to sail around the world on her own now ? Why not sail with a parent first to gain more experience ? '
