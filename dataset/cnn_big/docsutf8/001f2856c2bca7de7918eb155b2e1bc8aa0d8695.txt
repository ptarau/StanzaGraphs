-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Each summer , more than 50,000 people pour into a cobblestone square in Tuscany for a gut-wrenching 90-seconds . 
That 's all it takes for the flamboyantly dressed jockeys of Italy 's legendary horse race -- Palio di Siena -- to race bareback around the medieval square . 
It 's been called the    most dangerous horse race in the world ' -- about as far away as you can get from the genteel green lawns of Britain 's Royal Ascot or the multimillion prize money bestowed on America 's Kentucky Derby . 
Now as the dust settles on this year 's colorful Palio di Siena , CNN takes a look at five weird and wonderful horse festivals from across the world . 
Palio di Siena , Italy 
On two days each year , the pretty town of Siena in northern Tuscany is transformed into an elaborate medieval race track , with 10 riders careering around the iconic city square three times . 
Dating back to the 17th century , each rider represents their local neighborhood , competing not just for the coveted victory banner -- but good luck for the coming year . 
Luminarias Festival , Spain 
Fire and horses may seem like an unlikely combination , but that 's exactly the dramatic scene which takes place in a small town in central Spain each year . 
Horse are ridden over blazing tree branches as part of the Luminaries Festival in San Bartolome de Pinares , in an effort to purify and protect the animals . 
The controversial tradition , which has been criticized by animal welfare groups , dates back 500 years and is held on the eve of Saint Anthony 's Day . 
Watch : From camel racing to prized jockey 
White Turf , Switzerland 
From fiery Spain to snowy Switzerland -- there 's not a bonfire in sight at the glitzy White Turf racing carnival , held on the frozen Lake St Moritz . 
The remarkable competition includes skijoring , where horses thunder around the icy track while their riders hold on for dear life to a harness at the back , trailing behind on skis . 
In such extreme weather -- around -20 C -- fur coats are the order of the day for the champagne-sipping spectators who are perhaps better known for their luxury lifestyles than racing tips . 
Pasola Festival , Indonesia 
The glitz and glam of snow-capped St Moritz could n't be further from the spear-wielding horsemen of Indonesia 's annual Pasola Festival . 
The fierce festival -- held on the island of Sumba -- sees two teams go head-to-head on elaborately decorated horses , throwing blunt spears at each other as part of an ancient ritual battle . 
It is believed that every drop of blood spilled will bring a good harvest . 
Soma-Nomaoi Festival , Japan 
If you like your ancient festivals a little less violent , there 's the 1,000-year-old Soma-Nomaoi wild horse chase in central Japan . 
The three-day festival sees samurai horsemen compete in different challenges -- from racing over a one kilometer track to battling over sacred flags . 
Dressed in extravagant armor , helmets , and carrying swords , the fantastical warriors appear to have stepped straight out from the 10th Century .
