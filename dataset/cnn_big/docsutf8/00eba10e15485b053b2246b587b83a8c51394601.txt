Las Vegas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Police are on an    intense ' and    extremely focused ' nationwide manhunt for the occupants of a black Range Rover at the center of a shooting on the Las Vegas Strip that claimed three lives . 
The incident involved a Maserati that was shot at and subsequently crashed into a taxi , which caught fire . 
The driver of the Maserati , whom family identified as Kenneth Cherry Jr. , died at a hospital . The taxi driver and a passenger also died . 
The shots were fired from the Range Rover , which Las Vegas police spokesman Bill Cassell said could be anywhere . 
Police have received multiple reports of vehicles that match the description , but    at this point , we have no information that the vehicle in the crime has been located , ' he said Friday . 
Cassell declined to say whether there was one suspect or several , citing the ongoing investigation . 
Cherry , an aspiring rapper known as Kenny Clutch , was driving his Maserati on Thursday when someone in the Range Rover fired several shots at his car as it headed north on Las Vegas Boulevard . 
The Maserati continued into the intersection of the boulevard and Flamingo Road and collided with a taxi , which caught fire , killing cab driver Michael Boldon , 62 , CNN affiliate KVVU said . 
   It is gut-wrenching , ' Boldon 's younger brother , Tehran Boldon , tearfully told KVVU .    My life mission will be to see them punished and brought to justice for the senseless thing they did . ' 
In a separate interview Friday with CNN , Tehran Boldon said that his brother 's son is a limousine driver on the Las Vegas Strip and he called his father to warn him to avoid the area after seeing a car afire -- not realizing that the taxi on fire belonged to his father . 
   He saw the accident and he tried to warn his dad to say avoid Flamingo -LRB- Road -RRB- ' because he knew his father was nearby at the Rio casino , Tehran Boldon said .    He called and he did n't get a response . So his father was the fatality in that accident that he was being warned to avoid . 
   We lost a real patriarch and brother , ' said Tehran Boldon . 
The son , 36 , works the same shift as his father did . The father 's body was burned beyond recognition and was identified by his cab assignment , Tehran Boldon said . He is also trying to provide the coroner 's office with his brother 's dental records , he said . 
A passenger in the taxi also died . A passenger in the Maserati and three others were injured in the pileup , Sheriff Douglas Gillespie said . 
The Clark County Office of the Coroner/Medical Examiner was conducting an autopsy of Cherry , 27 , a representative said Friday . The office was n't releasing further information Friday about Boldon or his passenger . 
The fire closed a block and a half of the Strip near some of its biggest draws : Caesars Palace , the Bellagio , Bally 's and the Flamingo . Police collected surveillance video from the casinos . 
The shooting took place two blocks from where rapper Tupac Shakur was killed in 1996 . 
Cherry prominently features his Maserati in a music video on YouTube . 
   Out of everyone I know in the rapping industry , there is no way I would have ever , ever expected to find that he was shot on the Las Vegas Strip in such an aggressive manner , ' said Vicki Greco , Cherry 's attorney .    He did n't have a -LRB- criminal -RRB- record or a history . He was just a good kid trying to make it and be a good father . ' 
Cherry had two children , she said .

   First time in Vegas , and then , like , the whole thing , what you know from movies only -- I was shocked , ' said Christine Gerstenberger , who was visiting from Germany . 
Thursday 's incident started about 4:20 a.m. with a dispute in the valet lot of the Aria hotel , about a block away , Gillespie said . Investigators have n't confirmed the cause of the altercation , but he said it spilled onto the street . 
The Maserati 's passenger and other witnesses are helping detectives piece together what happened , he said . The    top priority ' for police is to find those who were inside the Range Rover , which sped away from the intersection . 
John Lamb , who was inside Caesars Palace , told CNN affiliate KLAS that he heard the commotion and saw the taxi on fire from a window .
