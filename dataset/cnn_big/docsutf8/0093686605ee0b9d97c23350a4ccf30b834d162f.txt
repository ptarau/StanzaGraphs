-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There are no easy answers when journalists have to decide how to cover a terrorist group 's video . 
The issue resurfaced Tuesday when a member of the Islamic extremist group ISIS was shown on camera beheading American journalist Steven Sotloff . No major news organization showed the gruesome conclusion of the ISIS video , but many did show screen grabs and short video clips of Sotloff and the executioner , as well as another hostage that ISIS is threatening to kill . 
The video is newsworthy -- even if it also plays into the propagandistic hands of the people who produced it . 
But a vocal flock of viewers and readers -- and some fellow journalists -- have deplored the decisions to show snippets of the video , reprising arguments that were made in August when news organizations showed screen grabs of James Foley , another American journalist who was beheaded by ISIS . 
   Ca n't believe this bears repeating , but one should not empower ISIS by publishing their PR materials , ' freelance journalist Jeb Boone wrote on Twitter after the Sotloff video emerged . 
One major international broadcaster , Al Jazeera , said it had decided not to show any images of Sotloff from the video -- a more conservative position than other television networks .    We suggest all media do the same , ' Al Jazeera 's public relations account said via Twitter , using the hashtag #ISISmediaBlackout . 
Not showing the video at all , however , risks sanitizing the grim reality of the world . 
So most media outlets tried to strike a balance . ISIS    would like us to show you the most graphic images on that video , as part of their campaign of terror . We will not , ' CBS News anchor Charlie Rose said as he introduced a segment about Sotloff 's death . Instead , CBS showed only video clips from it . 
Media figures also tried to demonstrate some self-awareness when dealing with the issue . 
   No way to avoid leading the show with ISIS butchery and yet , maddeningly , that also seems like what ISIS wants , ' Chris Hayes wrote on Twitter before his 8 p.m. MSNBC program . 
Newscasts tended to show more photos of Sotloff in the field , reporting on stories throughout the Middle East , than of him as a hostage . But screen grabs from the video were still widespread , including on CNN 's homepage and television networks . 
The Foley video surfaced on the social media website Diaspora , as reported by INSITE , a blog on terrorism and extremism run by the SITE Intelligence group . It was later put on YouTube and promoted via Twitter . 
The Sotloff video was discovered on an unidentified file-sharing website by the SITE Intelligence Group , which researches terrorist threats . Perhaps that 's why social media reactions to the Sotloff video were more muted -- or perhaps , terribly , it 's because the shock value was diminished the second time around .
