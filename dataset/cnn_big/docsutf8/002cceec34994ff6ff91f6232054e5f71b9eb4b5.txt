Atlanta -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Republican presidential hopeful Herman Cain told supporters Saturday that he is suspending his presidential campaign , which has become hobbled in recent weeks by allegations of sexual harassment and an Atlanta woman 's claim that they carried on a 13-year affair . 
While he will still be able to raise and spend campaign funds because he did not officially drop out , Cain 's White House bid is effectively over . 
Cain said he came to the decision after assessing the impact that the allegations were having on his wife , his family and his supporters . 
Cain and his wife , Gloria , held hands as they walked up to the podium where Cain made his remarks in Atlanta . The crowd chanted ,    Gloria ! Gloria ! ' before the candidate spoke . 
Even as he stepped aside under the weight of the allegations that have dogged him , Cain said that he was at    peace with my God ' and    peace with my wife . ' 
He repeatedly called the allegations    false and untrue , ' and added that    the -LRB- media -RRB- spin hurts . ' 
   I am not going to be silenced and I will not go away , ' Cain said , announcing what he called his Plan B : A website , TheCainSolutions.com , through which he will continue to advocate for his platform . 
His catchy    9-9-9 ' economic plan is not going anywhere , he said . 
   Your support has been unwavering and undying , ' Cain told his supporters . 
He will endorse another of the Republican presidential hopefuls soon , he said . 
Other candidates were quick to react . 
   Herman Cain provided an important voice to this process , ' Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann said in a statement .    His ideas and energy generated tremendous enthusiasm for the conservative movement at a time it was so desperately needed to restore confidence in our country . ' 
Fellow Georgian Newt Gingrich said the    9-9-9 ' plan    got our country talking about the critical issue of how to reform our tax code and he elevated the dialogue of the Republican presidential primary in the process . ' 
Texas Gov. Rick Perry said he knew the Cains made a    difficult decision . He helped invigorate conservative voters and our nation with a discussion of major tax reform . ' 
Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman said Cain brought    a unique and valuable voice to the debate over how to reform our country 's uncompetitive tax code and turn around the economy . I understand his decision and wish him and his family the best . ' 
Recently , Cain acknowledged that Ginger White 's allegations of an affair have led to a drop in campaign contributions , and a Des Moines Register poll showed his support among likely Republican Iowa caucus-goers has fallen to 8 % , down from 23 % in October . The poll has a sampling error of plus or minus 4.9 points , the newspaper said . 
Respondents said they were most concerned that Cain does not understand important issues , but said the allegations against him contribute to their concern , the newspaper said . 
This week , White told the news media that she and Cain engaged in an on-and-off affair for more than 13 years . She described the affair as    very casual . ' 
White issued a statement , through her attorney , after Cain 's announcement Saturday . 
   Ginger White respects Mr. Cain 's decision regarding his campaign and indeed would have respected any decision he made , ' the statement said .    That being said , she is disappointed that he has not apologized for the public statements he has made about her and other women who have spoken out . ' 
In a fund-raising letter Tuesday night , Cain referred to White as    troubled . ' 
Two women -- Sharon Bialek and Karen Kraushaar -- previously accused Cain of sexually harassing them in the 1990s while he was head of the National Restaurant Association . Two other women also have said Cain sexually harassed them while they worked at the association , but they have declined to be identified . 
Cain told the Union Leader in New Hampshire that he repeatedly gave White money to help her with    month-to-month bills and expenses . ' But he denied the relationship was sexual , as White contends . He said the two were friends . 
   I send checks to a lot of people ; I help a lot of people , ' Cain told Fox News on Thursday .    That in itself is not proof . So the other allegation in terms of it being a 13-year physical relationship , that is her words against my word . ' 
In the interview , Cain said his wife , knew nothing about White nor his financial support for her until the mother of two came forward last week . 
   My wife now knows , ' he told the newspaper .    My wife and I have talked about it , and I have explained it to her . My wife understands that I 'm a soft-hearted , giving person . ' 
Cain 's announcement came a month before the Iowa caucuses , the first formal test of the primary season , scheduled for January 3 . 
New Hampshire Republican officials who supported Cain began to survey their options Saturday , with several state representatives saying their support could go to Gingrich or Ron Paul . Cain 's most prominent supporter in the state , former GOP state party chair Jack Kimball , said he would wait to learn who Cain would endorse before making his own decision . 
Cain told staffers earlier this week he was reassessing his campaign in the wake of White 's allegation of an affair , and he acknowledged to reporters Wednesday that her account had led to a drop in contributions to his campaign . 
He said in the Thursday Union Leader interview that his wife 's feelings , as well as the reaction from supporters and donors , would be important factors in deciding whether he will stay the race . 
Cain told the newspaper he would drop out of the race if his wife asked him to , but quickly added that she would n't . 
Though Gloria Cain rarely makes public appearances or statements , she told Fox News last month that she believed the sexual harassment allegations were    unfounded . '
