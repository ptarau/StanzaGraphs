Fancy a stroll around the observation deck of the tallest building in the world ? 
Normally , doing so would involve a flight to Dubai , an expensive hotel room and a struggle through traffic under blazing sunshine . But now you can take it all in from the comfort of your own living room . 
Google has launched a new project capturing a 360-degree view of the iconic Burj Khalifa in Dubai -- a building so enormous it is sometimes referred to as the    vertical city . ' 
The images taken by Google allow users to navigate through the building , using Street View technology , which the company generally uses to map cities . Users can explore the structure from the opulent basement entrance hall to the highest occupied apartment in the world on the building 's 163rd floor . 
To compile the images , Google 's photographers used state of the art equipment and battled 40 mph winds at the top of the building 's spire , 828 meters -LRB- 2,716 feet -RRB- above ground level . 
The pictures will be the first time Street View has been used in the Middle East , and the first collection of images to feature a skyscraper . 
The Burj Khalifa is the tallest man-made structure in the world . Modeled on principles of classical Islamic architecture . The building took six years and more than 22 million man-hours to erect . 
The edifice 's massive foundations required over 58,900 cubic yards of concrete , weighing more than 110,000 tonnes . Close to 26,000 glass panels , each individually hand-cut , were used in the exterior cladding -- equivalent to 17 soccer fields of material . 
Google 's Street View technology had to be specially adapted to document buildings such as this . The 360 degree cameras are mounted on a backpack which can be carried by a single operator . Other landmarks and natural wonders like the Eiffel Tower and Grand Canyon have also been captured by the technology .
