Gaza City -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With the latest failed cease-fire quickly becoming a distant memory , the two sides in the Israel-Gaza conflict traded rockets and airstrikes Saturday -- as well as blame for not stopping the bloodshed . 
Israeli airstrikes killed at least five more people in Gaza on Saturday , the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported . 
The area around central Gaza 's Qassam mosque , in particular , was a frenzy of activity as medical workers sifted through rubble there . WAFA claimed that Israeli fighter jets struck that mosque and another , killing at least three people . 
Less than a mile away from the Qassam mosque , a strike killed two men riding on a motorbike , Palestinian Health Ministry spokesman Dr. Ashraf el-Qedra said . Israel 's military confirmed the strike , saying the two men were militants . 
El-Qedra added Saturday night that a 13-year-old girl died in an airstrike on her family home in Rafah . That was in addition to a 10-year-old boy who died while playing with friends , the Palestinian health ministry said . 
Then again , Israel is on the defensive as well . 
The Israel Defense Forces said that , since the end of the cease-fire early Friday , about 100 rockets were fired toward Israel from Gaza . 
That figure includes at least 30 launched Saturday , of which 24 hit Israel , the military said . 
The IDF responded by targeting    some 120 terror sites and nine terror operatives . ' 
All this back-and-forth , of course , is nothing new . 
The Israelis and Palestinians -- particularly Hamas , the Islamic militant group and political party that controls Gaza -- have been at it for weeks , with the former fending off persistent rocket attacks and the latter dealing with relentless Israeli strikes . 
There have been efforts to halt the bloodshed as well as to broach some of the thorny issues related to it . And there have been some breakthroughs , including a few cease-fires . 
Yet none of those peacemaking attempts , so far , has stuck . 
Death toll 's rise slows 
The death toll 's climb has slowed since IDF announced overnight into Saturday an end of its ground incursion in Gaza -- even as it continued to strike from the air . Israeli forces say troops redeployed after completed their mission of destroying Hamas  tunnels . 
Still , while there were n't scores of dead Saturday as has been true many other days over the past few weeks , the total carnage remains significant . 
According to el-Qedra , at least 1,911 in Gaza have died since the conflict began , in addition to just under 10,000 injured . 
It 's unclear how many casualties were militants : The United Nations estimates that about 70 % of the dead were civilians , or about 1,340 . IDF , meanwhile says about 900 militants have been killed , which would put the civilian death toll at around 1,000 . 
IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said that that number was a preliminary estimate based on field reports from troops returning from battle . 
Israeli officials say 64 Israeli soldiers have died , and three civilians were killed in Israel . The Iron Dome missile defense system has intercepted many of the rockets Gazan militants have fired at populated areas of the country . 
Blame game continues 
Besides the violence , another thing that has n't stopped is the blame game . 
One point of contention : who broke the most recent cease-fire hours before it was supposed to run out ? 
Hamas denied firing rockets into Israel on Friday . 
Yet militants from Islamic Jihad and the Al-Nasser Salah al-Din Brigades admitted to doing just that -- blaming Israel for refusing to accept their demands during negotiations . 
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said it was Hamas  fault regardless , telling CNN the group runs Gaza and    ca n't outsource terrorism to the other groups . When they want to enforce a cease-fire , they do it very well . ' 
Hamas has been in charge of the Palestinian government in Gaza for years , while the Palestinian faction Fatah runs the government in the West Bank . The two groups have been at odds but also made repeated efforts at a unity government , including one earlier this year . 
One sad irony of all this bloodshed is that -- according to the Egyptian foreign ministry , which brokered recent talks -- the parties have reached an agreement on most issues . Those not agreed upon were few and limited , the ministry said in a statement . 
Still , there 's too much history to show that agreement on some issues will not necessarily lead to a grander breakthrough . 
The Palestinians have asked for Israel to lift its blockade on Gaza and to re-open the air and seaports , a Palestinian negotiation who spoke on condition of anonymity said . Israeli authorities fear Hamas could import weapons by sea and maintains a ship blockade off Gaza 's shores . 
Palestinians also wanted Israel to extend Gaza 's fishing zone in the Mediterranean from three miles off the coast to 20 . Fishing is a keystone of Gazan livelihoods . But Israel was willing to extend fishing rights to only six miles off the coast , said Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri . 
Yet Israel is resisting in-depth talks as long as rockets continue to head toward its territory . 
After Gazan rocket fire on Friday , Israel 's Foreign Ministry said the country    will not conduct negotiations while under fire . '
