-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Five more Georgia men were charged in connection with an anti-government militia with ties to Fort Stewart that 's been accused of killing two people and plotting to assassinate President Barack Obama , authorities said Tuesday . 
The five defendants were indicted in Liberty County , Georgia , on charges that include violation of the Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act , involving what prosecutors called an    identified criminal street gang ' named FEAR , for Forever Enduring , Always Ready . 
Four U.S. Army soldiers at Fort Stewart had already been accused of being members of the anarchist group , which was allegedly stockpiling weapons and bomb parts to overthrow the U.S. government , prosecutors said . 
The four soldiers are accused of killing former GI Michael Roark and his teenage girlfriend , Tiffany York .

Under one of three indictments returned Monday by a Liberty County grand jury , Christopher Jenderseck was charged with three Street Gang Act violations and two counts of tampering with evidence in the killings of Roark and York in neighboring Long County , said District Attorney Tom Durden and Assistant District Attorney Isabel Pauley of the Atlantic Judicial Circuit . 
In a second indictment , defendant Timothy Martin Joiner is charged with burglary , theft by taking and two Street Gang Act violations . Adam Dearman is charged with three Street Gang Act offenses . 
In the third indictment , Joiner , Adam Dearman , Randall Blake Dearman and Anthony Garner are charged jointly , prosecutors said . Joiner and Randall Dearman each face two counts of burglary , nine counts of entering an auto , two counts of financial transaction card theft , one count of theft by taking , one count of criminal damage to property in the second degree , and 14 counts of Street Gang Act violations , prosecutors said . 
In addition , Adam Dearman is indicted on three counts of Street Gang Act violations , and Garner is charged with theft by receiving stolen property and one Street Gang Act count , prosecutors said . 
Jenderseck was arrested Tuesday in North Dakota , but Joiner and Garner were n't in custody , authorities said Tuesday . 
Regarding the charges against the four soldiers , a law enforcement official said they had legally purchased at least 18 rifles and handguns in Washington and Georgia . 
Uncompleted pipe bombs were also found , and were comprised of store-bought materials , the official said . No sophisticated military grade-explosives were involved in their construction . 
One official described the offenses as a murder case and said no federal charges had been filed . 
Last month , Pfc. Michael Burnett laid out the elaborate plot , telling a southeast Georgia court that he was part of what prosecutors called    an anarchist group and militia . ' 
Dressed in his Army uniform , he spoke in a Long County court about the group of Army soldiers and its role in the December deaths of Roark and York . 
Roark , he said , was killed because he took money from the group and planned to leave . 
   I do n't know how it got to the point where two people got murdered , ' Burnett said in court . 
He talked about how he and three others accused -- Pvt. Isaac Aguigui , Sgt. Anthony Peden and Pvt. Christopher Salmon -- had begun getting together ,    just going out shooting guns , just guy stuff . ' 
   And then Aguigui introduced me to   the manuscript ,  that 's what he called it , a book about true patriots , ' the soldier said . 
The four men became part of a group that aimed    to give the government back to the people , ' according to Burnett , who said that revolution was its goal . They called it FEAR -- Forever Enduring Always Ready -- and spent thousands of dollars buying guns and bomb parts .

The government needed a change , Burnett told the court .    I thought we were the people who would be able to change it . ' 
It is not clear how capable the group was of carrying out the goals Burnett laid out . 
Assistant District Attorney Pauley identified Aguigui as the leader of what she described as    an anarchist group and militia ' that included active and former troops . 
   Defendant Aguigui actively recruited new members at Fort Stewart -LRB- in southeast Georgia -RRB- and targeted soldiers who were in trouble or disillusioned , ' she said . 
At the time of their arrest , group members had plotted a number of    acts of domestic terror , ' the prosecutor said . 
These included    forcibly taking over the ammo control point of Fort Stewart to take the post , bombing vehicles of local and state judicial and political figureheads and federal representatives to include the local department of homeland security , -LRB- and plotting -RRB- to bomb the fountain at Forsyth Park in Savannah . ' 
Days before he died , Roark had been discharged from the Army , according to Pauley . 
Roark and his girlfriend were killed because Aguigui felt the couple was    a loose end , ' Burnett said . 
Burnett admitted being at the scene of the crime , including watching as a soldier    checked -LRB- York 's -RRB- pulse and then shot her again . ' 
As part of an agreement with prosecutors , Burnett pleaded guilty to manslaughter -- instead of murder , thus avoiding a possible death sentence -- and other charges . He also agreed to testify against the three other soldiers accused in the case . 
All four soldiers had also been charged by the military in connection with the two killings . But as their case proceeded through civilian courts , the Army dismissed its charges , according to Fort Stewart spokesman Kevin Larson . 
In a statement last month , Larson insisted that Fort Stewart and its affiliated Hunter Army Airfield do not have    a gang or militia problem . ' 
   Any suspicions of gang activity are actively investigated by CID , -LRB- which -RRB- recognizes the obvious concerns with the combination of gangs and military-type training , ' he said . 
   That is why CID monitors and investigates gang and extremist group association with criminal acts in the Army so closely . We believe the reason we are able to maintain a low gang criminal threat status is because of the awareness of and focus on the threat . ' 
Fort Stewart , about 40 miles southwest of Savannah , is home to the U.S. Army 's 3rd Infantry Division . 
Tens of thousands of troops , their dependents , civilian personnel and contractors live and work on the base , which encompasses 280,000 acres and includes parts of five counties , including Long County , which has about 14,500 residents . Hunter Army Airfield is in Savannah but is officially part of the larger Fort Stewart complex . 
The Southern Poverty Law Center , which tracks what it characterizes as    hate groups ' nationwide , spoke to Aguigui 's father last month . 
   I served my country for 20 years and I honor that , take pride in that , ' Ed Aguigui told the center , according to the center 's Hatewatch blog .    I do n't know what my son 's views are , and where they came from . '
