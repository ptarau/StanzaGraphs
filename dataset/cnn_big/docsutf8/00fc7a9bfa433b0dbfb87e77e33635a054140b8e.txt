-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- So , Gary Oldman , tell us what you really think . 
In a raw interview with Playboy , the actor , 56 , railed against Hollywood    dishonesty ' and double standards , said that Mel Gibson and Alec Baldwin have been victims of hypocrisy and asserted that not voting for    12 Years a Slave ' to win an Oscar meant    you were a racist . ' 
Oh , and he does n't like the Golden Globes , helicopter parents or reality TV , either . 
Indeed , the    Dark Knight ' actor , who 's starring in the forthcoming    Dawn of the Planet of the Apes , ' pulled no punches when talking about pretty much anything . The conversation will appear in the magazine 's July/August issue . 
The Gibson and Baldwin affairs really angered him , he said , because he believes their accusers do n't exactly have clean hands themselves . 
   I do n't know about Mel . He got drunk and said a few things , but we 've all said those things . We 're all f *** ing hypocrites , ' Oldman said .    The policeman who arrested him has never used the word   n *****  or   that f *** ing Jew  ? I 'm being brutally honest here . It 's the hypocrisy of it that drives me crazy . 
   Mel Gibson is in a town that 's run by Jews and he said the wrong thing because he 's actually bitten the hand that I guess has fed him -- and does n't need to feed him anymore because he 's got enough dough , ' Oldman continued .    But some Jewish guy in his office somewhere has n't turned and said ,   That f *** ing kraut  or   F *** those Germans ,  whatever it is ? We all hide and try to be so politically correct . That 's what gets me . It 's just the sheer hypocrisy of everyone . ' 
Other Oldman tidbits : 
On reality TV :    The museum of social decay . ' 
On helicopter parents :    There 's never any unsupervised play to develop skills or learn about hierarchy in a group or how to share . The kids honestly believe they are the center of the f *** ing universe . But then they get out into the real world and it 's like , 'S ** t , maybe it 's not all about me ,  and that leads to narcissism , depression and anxiety . ' 
On political correctness at the Oscars :    At the Oscars , if you did n't vote for '12 Years a Slave  you were a racist . ' 
On the Golden Globes :    A meaningless event . ... It 's 90 nobodies having a wank . ' 
If Oldman is hard on Hollywood and its people , he 's equally critical of himself . Asked about    Sid & Nancy , ' his breakthrough film , he said ,    I do n't like myself in the movie . ' Ditto with    The Fifth Element ' and    The Dark Knight . ' 
   It was work , ' he said . -LRB- He did have kind things to say about the film    Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy , ' Francis Ford Coppola and    Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban ' director Alfonso Cuaron . -RRB- 
As the interview continued , Oldman -- who described his politics as    libertarian ' -- recognized that he may have been a little too blunt . 
   So this interview has gone very badly . You have to edit and cut half of what I 've said , because it 's going to make me sound like a bigot , ' he said at one point 
   You 're not a bigot ? ' replied interviewer David Hochman . 
   No , but I 'm defending all the wrong people , ' Oldman said .    I 'm saying Mel 's all right . Alec 's a good guy . So how do I come across ? Angry ? ' 
   Passionate , certainly , ' Hochman said .    Readers will have to form their own opinions . ' 
   It 's dishonesty that frustrates me most , ' Oldman said .    I ca n't bear double standards . It gets under my skin more than anything . '
