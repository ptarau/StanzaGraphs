Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama has approved the use of armed Predator drones in Libya , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday . 
Gates suggested that the unmanned Predator missions may have already begun . He said he believed that the first flights were launched Thursday but were called back due to poor weather . 
   The president has said that where we have some unique capabilities , he is willing to use those , ' Gates said .    And I think that today may in fact have been their first mission . ' 
Gates said the Predator drones offer a    modest contribution ' to NATO efforts to support rebels fighting embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's forces there , though Gadhafi is not a specific target . 
Unmanned aerial vehicles offer more precise targeting , because their low-flying capability allows for better visibility ,    particularly on targets now that have started to dig themselves into defensive positions , ' Gates said . 
He said the drones are needed for humanitarian reasons , and they have capabilities that larger aircraft such as A-10s and C-130s can not provide . 
Vice Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. James Cartwright said the added precision is necessary because forces loyal to Gadhafi    nestle up in crowded areas ' to maximize civilian casualties . 
   It 's very difficult to identify friend from foe , ' Cartwright said , noting that the drones facilitate identification of individuals on the ground . 
Remote Predator operators are now permitted to strike Gadhafi 's defense missions , including air defense , missile and radar sites . Predator strikes are also authorized for civilian protection and can hit Gadhafi 's troops , military installations and equipment in the field . 
The U.S. employed the use of unmanned drones early in the NATO campaign , but they were intended for surveillance only and not authorized to fire .
