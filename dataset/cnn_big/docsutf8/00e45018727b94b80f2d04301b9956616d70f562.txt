Yangon , Myanmar -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Australian editor of a Myanmar newspaper was ordered to remain in jail after a court hearing in Yangon Thursday . 
Officials revealed at the hearing that Ross Dunkley , the editor of the Myanmar Times , faces charges related to torturing and drugging a woman . 
Dunkley was arrested in early February . At the time , authorities said he faced immigration charges . 
At the hearing Thursday , authorities added the drug and torture charges stating that Myanmar law dictates that any foreigner who faces criminal charges always faces additional immigration charges . 
The woman making the allegations against Dunkley was at the hearing , and said the editor gave her a drug on two occasions that hampered her memory . On the second time , the woman said she jumped out of Dunkley 's car to escape . 
Dunkley denied all charges and requested to be released on bond , which was denied . 
But in a strange twist , the woman told the judge that she wanted to drop her allegations and withdraw the case . 
   The woman who had made allegations of physical assault against Mr. Dunkley told the court that she wanted to withdraw her complaint , ' David Armstrong , chairman of Post Media Ltd. and a friend of Dunkley 's who is serving as his spokesman , said in a statement .    She admitted that she made allegations during the hearing that she had not made in her initial police interview . ' 
A judge asked her to consider her request and scheduled another hearing for March 3 . 
Officials from the Australian Embassy in Myanmar attended the hearing , Armstrong said . 
Myanmar Times is one of a few newspapers owned and run by a foreigner in the nation . Dunkley 's arrest comes amid a business dispute with the paper 's local partner . 
   I can not say for sure that the cause behind Ross  arrest was driven by business dispute because I was not with him in Myanmar , ' said Armstrong .    But what I can say , all the troubles came to Ross at an odd timing as there was a business negotiation with his local partner going on . '
