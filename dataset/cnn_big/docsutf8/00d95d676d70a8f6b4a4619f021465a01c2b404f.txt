-LRB- CNN -RRB- --    These types of patients have such disfigurement beforehand they ca n't eat , they ca n't breathe properly . It 's about functionality , ' says Dr. Richard Luskin , CEO of the New England Organ Bank . 
Luskin is referring to the small group of people worldwide who are on waiting lists in hope of a new face , and in the United States at least , they may now have one donated to them more readily . 
Last month the United Network of Organ Sharing -LRB- UNOS -RRB- , a non-profit organization managing the U.S. organ transplant system , approved the first national policies for the transplantation of limbs , faces and other structures collectively known as    vascularized composite allografts ' -LRB- VCAs -RRB- -- which should make it easier to find donors . 
As of April 2014 , there had been 28 face transplants across the world . Animal attacks , severe burns and gunshot wounds had left these recipients scarred for life , literally , in the one place their scars can not be hidden -- their face . 
   Anyone with this disfigurement would argue they 're not living , they 're surviving , ' says Luskin . 
Face transplant recipients : New findings 
A growing field 
The first face transplant was performed in France in 2005 on Isabelle Dinoire , whose mouth , nose and chin had been chewed away by her dog . Since then the field has grown and transplants involving varying combinations of facial parts have been performed in six other countries , including the United States . 
As the procedures improve and their safety grows , donor registries and collaborating hospitals will increasingly be asking the question : Would you like to donate your face ? Or in the case of the UNOS approval , asking family members of potential donors the sensitive question of whether they will donate the face of their loved one . 
The UNOS approval will initially be in place temporarily for 15 months to enable public comment , but families of donors will receive extra guidance when it comes to making the decision .    Face transplants remain unique and require very specific criteria such as hairlines and ethnic components , ' explains a UNOS spokesperson .    Therefore consent should be distinct and individual . ' 
' -LRB- This -RRB- will broaden the donor pool for wait-listed patients across a number of regional and national organ procurement organizations , ' explains Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez , professor of reconstructive plastic surgery at NYU Langone Medical Center .    A major component for a successful procedure is patient selection on both the recipient and donor , ' he adds .    The likeliness of a perfect match can be very challenging . ' 
But this once-experimental procedure is becoming more widespread and accepted . Richard Norris , from Virginia , received a new face in March 2012 and last month his face was featured on the cover of the U.S. edition of men 's magazine GQ . Norris lost most of his facial features after a gun blast , and lost abilities such as his sense of smell . But after surgery at the hands of Rodriguez and his team he can live his life once again . 
Face transplant patients : Where are they now ? 
Risk of rejection 
However , as this mode of surgery becomes a norm , the side effects and risks that come with the life-changing operation are still a concern and a question of ethics . 
Like any other transplant , there is a risk of the new organ being rejected by the patient 's immune system and recipients have to take immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives , putting them at risk of infections and cancer . But unlike many other transplants , replacing a face is not a matter of life and death . The surgery is classed by some as life-changing , not life-saving , which raises questions as to whether this risk is justified . 
   For heart transplant patients they need a transplant or they will die . These -LRB- face transplant -RRB- patients are not in organ failure but are having to take anti-rejection medication and have lifelong repression , ' explains Dr. Maria Siemionow , from the University of Illinois , who performed a near-total face transplant in 2008 on American Connie Culp , who was shot in the face by her husband . 
But Siemionow is working to solve this problem .    We need new therapies which will be less harmful , ' she says . 
The Polish surgeon is developing chimeric cells , which bring together the cells from a donor and the recipient during transplantation .    We are fusing together cells from the bone marrow of donors and recipients so these cells will be recognized by the recipient 's immune systems as their own , ' she explains . Not an easy task . 
By combining the two cells and delivering them into patients receiving a transplant , their immune system will learn to recognize the donor 's cells , which are present throughout their new face , making their immune cells less likely to attack the face . 
   If the -LRB- immune system -RRB- can recognize more cells as   self  the patient will need less anti-rejection drugs , ' says Siemionow , whose experimental therapy is hoped to enter clinical trials in a few years and when it does , may make face transplants more acceptable to critics . 
   Immunosupression is the main ethical concern and new therapies are crucial for the future of this field , ' she says . 
Luskin feels the benefits of a new face counter ethical doubts .    There is no ethical issue , ' he concludes .    I saw a patient walking down a crowded hospital hall a few years after surgery and no-one noticed them . He looked like a normal guy . To me , that 's the point of these surgeries . '
