Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Republicans  chances of winning control of the Senate in Tuesday 's midterm elections are now up to 95 % , according to CNN 's Pivit , an analysis that combines experts  projections with political watchers  predictions on key races . 
The jump was driven largely by a Des Moines Register poll over the weekend that put Republican Joni Ernst 7 percentage points ahead of Democrat Bruce Braley in a Senate race seen as a must-win for Democrats . 
In that race , Pivit puts Ernst 's chances at 88 % . Pivit also offers bad news for Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado , whose chances are at just 6 % , and Sen. Mark Pryor in Arkansas , who 's down to 2 % . 
Pivit 's analysis suggests Democrats are in better shape in North Carolina , where Sen. Kay Hagan has a 69 % chance of holding off Republican challenger Thom Tillis , and in New Hampshire , where Sen. Jeanne Shaheen 's chances of beating Scott Brown are up to 81 % . 
Republicans , meanwhile , look to have put Kentucky 's Senate race out of reach . Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell 's chances of surviving a challenge from Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes are up to 97 % . 
Republicans need a net gain of six seats to capture a majority . Pick-ups in Montana , South Dakota and West Virginia are all but assured , and Democratic incumbents are facing uphill battles in Alaska , Arkansas and Louisiana , as well . 
Republicans are also hoping for wins in states like Colorado , Iowa , New Hampshire and North Carolina -- which would help solidify their chances of gaining a majority by providing insulation in case the GOP loses seats of its own in Georgia and Kansas .
