-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jessica Heeringa , 25 , was due to close the Michigan gas station where she was working alone as a cashier at 11:30 p.m. Friday . But at 11:15 , police got a 911 call that the station was unmanned . When police responded , Heeringa was gone . 
   Something very bad happened , ' the police chief of Norton Shores , a community of 22,500 near Lake Michigan about 40 miles west of Grand Rapids , told CNN affiliate WOOD-TV . 
   This was an abduction , not just a missing person , ' Chief Daniel Shaw told the station . 
   There was nothing disturbed inside the store . There was no sign of a struggle or a robbery had occurred , ' Shaw told the station . Heeringa 's purse was left in the store , and her car was still there , WOOD reported . 
Heeringa last served a customer about 10:50 p.m. , police said . 
   Between the time that last purchase was made and the time that the customers came in and found the store empty is when Jessica was abducted , ' Shaw told WOOD .    We have spoken with the person who made the purchase there and cleared them of any wrong . And unfortunately , they did n't see anything that would lead them to believe there was something going on at the store that was leading to that abduction . ' 
The chief told the station police are looking for the driver of a silver minivan who was seen in the store 's parking area late Friday . 
Shaw described him as a white male , between 30 and 40 , with wavy hair parted in the middle , according to WOOD . The van could have been a Chrysler Town and Country , he told the station . The store did not have security cameras , leaving police with few other clues . 
   We are desperately looking for additional information , ' he told WOOD on Monday morning . 
Heeringa 's family and friends were posting missing posters around the area , and a Facebook page was set up for people to offer clues or support . 
   We are searching ! Hang tight ! The whole Country wants you home ! ' said a Facebook post from Monday morning . Tips had come in from as far away as New Jersey , Missouri and Arkansas , WOOD reported . 
Heeringa is described as 5 feet , 1 inches tall , 110 pounds with blond hair , blue eyes and wearing wire-rimmed glasses . She has a 3-year-old son , her family told CNN affiliate WZZM-TV . 
Besides local police , the county sheriff 's department and the Michigan State Police were involved in the investigation , according to local media reports . The FBI has also been contacted , the reports said . 
   We 've got a team of detectives and investigators on staff all day and night to track down those leads , ' Shaw told WOOD . 
   We are very concerned . It 's been too long , ' Heeringa 's grandfather , Roman Homrich , told Mlive.com on Monday . 
Heeringa 's mother , Shelly Heeringa , told WZZM that she thinks her daughter 's abductor was a past customer who knew Jessica and the store . 
   She 's very helpful , that 's why I think he lured her out of the gas station , ' the mother told the station .    He knew there was n't security cameras . ' 
People with information that may help find Heeringa are asked to call the Norton Shores police at 231-733-2691 .
