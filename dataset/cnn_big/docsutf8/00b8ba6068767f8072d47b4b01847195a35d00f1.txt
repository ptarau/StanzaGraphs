-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- From personal stories of growing up with gay parents to challenges of what defines a family , the public 's comments on same-sex couples having families was supportive and critical , calm and heated -- sometimes all in one conversation thread . 
In CNN 's documentary    Gary and Tony Have a Baby , ' Soledad O'Brien follows a gay couple in their struggle through the legal and personal obstacles to become parents . We asked readers and viewers what they thought about gay couples having families . 
   Whether they are gay as a couple , or gay as a single parent -- as long as they love and nourish that child it will make absolutely no difference . Compared to the atrocious things that we read here on CNN about what parents do to their children , being raised by a gay parent will be a blessing , ' says one reader .    I work in a medical clinic and believe me , the large number of gay people/couples that we see are a helluva lot more   normal  -LRB- and pleasant -RRB- than the straight people/couples ! ' 
Others said that while they were against same-sex marriage , they saw no reason for sexual orientation to prevent having children through adoption or other means . 
   My morals and my religion agree that marriage is between a man and a woman , ' says one reader . ' -LSB- But -RSB- I do n't mind gays adopting . ' 
Another said :    Marriage is an institution created by God to join a man and a women . That being said , children do need someone to love and if that person is psychologically sound , physically fit and has the wherewithal to create a supportive and loving environment for the child , it would -LSB- be -RSB- hard for me to say no way . ' 
Some said having same-sex parents would harm the child .    Children being raised by gay couples can easily be targeted by bullies , ' said one reader .    These children will go through a great suffering because they will be confused as to why they do n't -LSB- have -RSB- a daddy or a mommy . It 's a shame that the children are being exposed to something that God is against . ' 
Another wrote :    If there is a mother and father possibility , -LSB- a child -RSB- should always go in the favor of the normal mother and father situation . It is the responsibility of those in charge to give them the best chance to survive in a culture that is normally straight . I am not against gays , but I do think there is a reality that one gender of parents is not the norm . ' 
Other readers shared their stories of growing up with same-sex parents or being a gay parent themselves . 
   As a gay single man , it has been my honor to adopt four wonderful children , ' one reader wrote .    Over the years we have encountered the typical family pressures as everyone else . Our only outward difference is that I am Caucasian and my children are African-American . Two of my four boys are now 18 and 19 . Both are headed to college . My younger two are 15 and 16 now . Both successful high school students , happy and well adjusted -LRB- well as adjusted as a teenager can be ! -RRB- . ... My kids know about my life and were told when they were young . I have kept no secrets . ... Parenting means being there for your child . It mean participating in their lives . Loving them . Listening to their goals , biting your tongue when necessary and losing your mind when needed . ' 
Another said ,    My parents love me , that 's all that matters . What makes you a better parent then mine ? Because you 're a Christian ? Because you are straight ? They love me and that 's all that matters . They push me to succeed , and make me the best person I can be . Is n't that what being a parent is , loving you for who you are ? '
