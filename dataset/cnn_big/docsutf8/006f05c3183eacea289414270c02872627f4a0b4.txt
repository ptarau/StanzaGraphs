-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Low visibility caused by mist and sand created poor flying conditions for the pilot of an Afriqiyah Airways flight that crashed just before landing in Tripoli , Libyan sources with knowledge of the investigation said Saturday . 
The plane , an Airbus A330-200 , originated in Johannesburg , South Africa , and was at the end of its nearly nine-hour flight when it crashed Wednesday . All but one of the 104 passengers on board were killed . 
The sources said that as the pilot approached Tripoli International Airport , he took the plane off auto-pilot hoping to manually land the aircraft . He realized he was in trouble and tried to pull the plane up and turn the auto-pilot back on to give it another try , the sources said . 
But the effort was too late and the plane slammed violently into the ground , explaining the condition of the wreckage and damage to the plane 's tail at the crash site , the sources said . 
An investigation into the crash is under way , and authorities are reviewing the aircraft 's flight data recorder . 
Meanwhile Ruben van Assouw , the 9-year-old sole survivor of the plane crash , has returned home to the Netherlands . 
He suffered multiple fractures to his legs and underwent surgery at Al Khadra Hospital , said a doctor at the hospital who declined to give her name . 
Both of Ruben 's parents and a brother were killed in the crash , a Dutch foreign ministry representative said . 
Ruben 's family issued a statement Friday expressing gratitude to people who have helped them , such as Libyan hospital professionals and Dutch envoys , as well as the outpourings of sympathy from citizens in both countries . 
The family also thanked    the vast majority of the Dutch media for respecting our privacy . ' 
The family , which will raise Ruben , said the boy knows that his parents and brother were killed . 
   Considering the circumstances , Ruben is doing fine . He is sleeping a lot ; now and then he wakes up and is then lucid , ' the family said in the statement .    He has drunk a little , and has seen the flowers and cuddly toys . ' 
Ruben 's family said it has to deal with    two kinds of grief ' -- the sorrow the boy is enduring and the sadness over the loss of the other family members . 
   The coming period will be very difficult for us , ' the family said .    We hope that all the media will respect our privacy . ' 
More than two-thirds of the passengers killed in the plane crash were Dutch , the ministry said . 
Passengers from Libya , South Africa , Belgium , Austria , Germany , France , Zimbabwe and Britain were also among the victims , the airline said on its Web site .
