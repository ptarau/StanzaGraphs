Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Six simple words have sent Hello Kitty lovers into a spin . 
   Hello Kitty is not a cat . ' 
The apparently shocking revelation was made in an LA Times article published Wednesday about a retrospective of Kitty paraphernalia opening next month at the Japanese American National Museum . 
The story started innocently enough before the bombshell was dropped by Christine R. Yano , an anthropologist at the University of Hawaii , who has delved more deeply than most into the Hello Kitty phenomenon . 
   That 's one correction Sanrio made for my script for the show , ' Yano told the LA Times . 
   Hello Kitty is not a cat . She 's a cartoon character . She is a little girl . She is a friend . But she is not a cat . She 's never depicted on all fours . She walks and sits like a two-legged creature . She does have a pet cat of her own , however , and it 's called Charmmy Kitty . ' 
Whoa . 
The news reached far and wide , including backstage after the Linkin Park gig at the Minnesota State Fair . 
   I just got off stage to find out that Hello Kitty is not a cat . This is worse than finding out Pluto is not a planet , ' tweeted clearly shocked rapper Mike Shinoda . 
For those who do n't know , Hello Kitty is an international superstar who was introduced to the world in 1974 by Japanese company Sanrio . 
In the last 40 years her button nose has appeared on a dazzling array of merchandise , generating billions of dollars for the company . 
Until now , her pointy ears and whiskers gave her legion of fans the distinct impression she was feline . 
Wrong . 
Summing up the disbelief , @jkltoraay tweeted :    You can not say hello kitty is not a cat after 40 years no human has whiskers and pointed ears and a little yellow nose . ' 
For some , the news raised more questions than it answered . 
   Been tossing and turning for the last few hours trying to figure out how Hello Kitty is n't a cat . How is it possible ? What does it mean ? ' @NotKennyRogers tweeted . 
   Since Hello Kitty is n't a cat , wtf is My Melody ? ' tweeted @mrsunlawyer . 
Users raced to update Kitty 's Wikipedia entry , which now reads :    She bears the appearance of a white Japanese bobtail cat with a red bow although she is actually a little girl . ' 
Singer Katy Perry stepped in to try to calm the masses :    IT 'S OKAY HELLO KITTY FANS , KITTY PURRY IS A CAT . ' 
At last count it was retweeted more than 13,000 times . 
As the Sanrio website clearly states , Hello Kitty is a    cheerful and happy little girl ... who lives in London with her mama -LRB- Mary White -RRB- , papa -LRB- George White -RRB- , and her twin sister Mimmy . ' 
Yes , she 's also British . 
For the record , Kitty 's birthday is November 1 , she likes baking and making pancakes , origami and eating apple pie . 
Her favorite saying is    You can never have too many friends . ' 
She may have lost a few today . 
Meow .
