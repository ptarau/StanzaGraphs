Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When the Obama administration unveils its National Security Strategy Thursday , it will be the first time a president explicitly recognizes the threat posed to the country by radicalized individuals at home . 
   For the first time since 9/11 , the NSS integrates homeland security and national security , ' according to highlights of the plan given to CNN by a senior administration official said . 
The security strategy acts as a blueprint for how the White House intends to protect Americans . In the past , it has focused mostly on international threats . But National Security Adviser John Brennan explained Wednesday that a spate of terror-related plots in the United States recently prompted the Obama administration to include homegrown terrorism in the document . 
   Such a strategy must begin with the recognition that a clear-eyed understanding of our strategic environment -- the world as it is today -- is necessary to shape the world that we seek , ' according to a summary of the plan . 
   Currently , the United States is focused on completing a responsible transition in Iraq , succeeding in Afghanistan , and defeating al Qaeda and its terrorist affiliates , while moving our economy from deep recession to enduring recovery . Even as we confront these crises , our national strategy must take a longer view . We must adapt and lead in a rapidly changing , interconnected world in which interests of nations and peoples are increasingly shared . ' 
Homegrown terrorism represents a new phase of the terrorist threat , officials said . 
Earlier this month , Pakistani-American Faisal Shahzad was charged with trying to detonate a car bomb in New York 's bustling district of Times Square . 
U.S. Army Major Nidal Malik Hasan is suspected of fatally shooting 13 people at Fort Hood in November . 
Colorado resident Najibullah Zazi , an Afghan national , pleaded guilty in February for conspiring to detonate explosives in the New York subway system . 
David Headley , an American citizen from Chicago , Illinois , is accused of providing surveillance in the Mumbai , India , terrorist attacks that killed 160 people . 
   We 've seen an increasing number of individuals here in the United States become captivated by extremist ideology or causes , ' Brennan said .    We have seen individuals , including U.S. citizens armed with their U.S. passports , travel easily to extremist safe havens , return to America , their deadly plans disrupted by coordinated intelligence and law enforcement . ' 
Brennan , who made his comments at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , said that as the United States has strengthened its defenses against massive attacks like 9/11 , al Qaeda has shown itself to be a    resilient , resourceful and determined enemy . ' 
Brennan said al Qaeda is recruiting individuals with little training , attempting relatively unsophisticated attacks and seeking people living in the United States to launch such attacks . 
   They are seeking foot soldiers who might slip through our defense , ' Brennan said .    As our enemy adapts and evolves their tactics , so must we constantly adapt and evolve ours . ' 
Brennan did not provide any specific details about the president 's strategy for combating al Qaeda and its affiliates , but said it    will require a broad , sustained and integrated campaign that harnesses every tool of American power , military and civilian , kinetic and diplomatic . ' 
The strategy is built around protecting    four enduring U.S. national interests -- security , prosperity , values , and international order . ' 
In order to achieve this , it must strengthen U.S. institutions , values , and infrastructure -- such as education , energy , science and technology , and health care . 
It calls for strong diplomatic efforts internationally and galvanizing    collective action to address the share global challenges of our time . ' 
   Engagement begins with our friends and allies -- active partners in advancing common interests . We will continue to deepen our partnerships with increasingly active centers of influence -- cooperating when we can , and differing when we must . 
   With adversarial regimes , engagement provides us a means of testing intentions , giving governments the opportunity to change course , and mobilizing international coalitions . ' 
The strategy calls for updating    all of the tools of American power , and work with our allies and partners to do the same . ' 
   These tools include those in the fields of defense , diplomatic , development , homeland security , the rule of law , intelligence , and strategic communications , as well as support the participation of the American people and private sector . We are working to strengthen each of these tools , but also to integrate them through coordinated planning and capacity building in key areas , ' the strategy said .
