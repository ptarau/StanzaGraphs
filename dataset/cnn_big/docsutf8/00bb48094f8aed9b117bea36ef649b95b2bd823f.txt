Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Naif Al-Mutawa anticipated a struggle when he launched an Islam-inspired comic book series that he hoped would become a symbol of tolerance . 
He worried about the comics being banned in Saudi Arabia - which wound up happening , briefly -- and he expected to be challenged by conservatives in Islam , since Al-Mutawa wanted to buck the trend of Islamic culture being directly tied to the Koran . 
But it was n't an Islamic cleric that stalled the series , called    The 99 , ' after the 99 attributes of Allah , which the superheroes are supposed to embody . 
It is the American market , and the voices of Islam 's Western critics , that have caused the most problems for    The 99 , ' says Al-Mutawa , who is the focus of a PBS documentary airing next week . 
In 2010 , President Barack Obama called the comic books , which debuted in 2006 ,    the most innovative response ' to America 's expanding dialogue with the Muslim world , which Obama has encouraged . The series features 99 superheroes from across the globe who team up to combat villains and who embody what Al-Mutawa calls basic human values like trust and generosity . 
But Al-Mutawa , a Kuwaiti-born clinical psychologist and graduate of Columbia Business School , says a vocal minority have raised surprising questions about American tolerance of Islam . 
The idea for    The 99 ' started during a conversation in a London cab between Al-Mutawa and his sister . It took off , although slowly , after Al-Mutawa raised $ 7 million from 54 investors across four continents . 
The first issue was released during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in 2006 . The comic book was quickly banned in Saudi Arabia and Al-Mutawa received threats of fatwas against him and his project from clerics . But Saudi Arabia eventually lifted the ban and the television adaptation of    The 99 ' will be aired there this year . 
Al-Mutawa and his team have now raised more than $ 40 million in venture capital for the project . 
But when word leaked that The Hub , a Discovery Channel cable and satellite television venture , purchased the series and planned to air it in the United States , the response from conservative bloggers and authors was swift . 
Pamela Geller , founder of the Atlas Shrugs blog , called the series , part of the    ongoing onslaught of cultural jihad , ' and created a counter-comic strip that made the 19 hijackers behind the September 11 , 2001 attacks the superheroes . 
New York Post columnist Andrea Peyser , meanwhile , urged readers to    Hide your face and grab the kids . Coming soon to a TV in your child 's bedroom is a posse of righteous , Sharia-compliant Muslim superheroes - including one who fights crime hidden head-to-toe by a burqa . ' 
According to Al-Mutawa , the criticism spooked The Hub .    All of a sudden we could n't get an air date and I was asked to be patient and we have been , ' Al-Mutawa said .    But it has been a year and the actual push-back died down . ' 
A spokesperson for The Hub told CNN that '   The 99  is one of the many shows we have on the possible schedule , but at this time , no decisions have been made about scheduling . ' 
Al-Mutawa is n't shy about responding to the criticism his comics have received in the U.S.    There is nothing different from them and the extremists in my country , ' he says .    They are just as bad . They are just intellectual terrorists . ' 
Geller , author of the book    Stop the Islamization of America , ' called Al-Mutawa 's statement    ridiculous victimhood rhetoric . ' 
   He is the one mainstreaming oppression and discrimination , ' Geller says .    I work for equality of rights for all people . So which one of us is the intellectual terrorist ? ' 
Geller also takes issue with Al-Mutawa 's assertion that    The 99 ' exemplifies    moderation ' and    toleration , ' pointing to a    burqa-wearing superhero . ' 
But Al-Mutawa says criticisms of burqas are evidence that ,    for some people anything to do with Islam is bad . ' 
   How clichÃ © is it that characters created to promote tolerance are getting shot down by extremists , ' he says . 
Al-Mutawa 's frustrations are chronicled in the new documentary    Wham ! Bam ! Islam ! , ' which will air on PBS on October 13 as part of the Independent Lens series . 
The film 's director , Isaac Solotaroff , began shooting before the comic was released . 
He said that one of the most surprising aspects of the story is how    a very small group of people who scream very loud , have a disproportionate share of the public discourse when it comes to culture . ' 
Echoing Al-Mutawa , Solotaroff calls it a case of the tail wagging the dog . He says that initial concerns of censorship in the Middle East began to change as the project progressed . 
   We were waiting for a fatwa from a cleric in Saudi Arabia , Solotaroff says , ' when it ended up being the U.S. market that has been resistant to    The 99 . ' 
   Realizing that The 99 will not survive if focused solely on the Middle East , Al-Mutawa must now target an international and predominantly non-Muslim market , ' reads the website for    Wham ! Bam ! Islam ! ' 
Citing The Hub holdup , Solotaroff says the project is now stuck in the most important market ' for    The 99 . ' 
Al-Mutawa is also trying to gain distribution for his TV series in France and other countries , but his main focus remains the United States . 
   One way or the other , ' he says , '   The 99  will get on air in the U.S. '
