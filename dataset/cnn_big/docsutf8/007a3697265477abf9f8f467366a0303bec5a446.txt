Mogadishu , Somalia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Blood and body parts littered the ground outside Turkey 's embassy in Somalia on Saturday afternoon , the grisly result of a blast that police said left six dead and nine wounded . 
A minivan packed with explosives went off around 5 p.m. in the heart of Mogadishu , just a few meters from the Turkish diplomatic post , said police Col. Ahmed Mohamud . 
When it was over , two Somali security guards , a university student and three attackers were dead , according to Mohamud . 
Turkish embassy sources said that two of its staff members were among the wounded . 
Somali police and Turkish embassy guards , meanwhile , converged on the scene . Mangled buses and cars ended up in a disfigured heap , while the windows of numerous nearby apartments were shattered . 
Al-Shabaab -- a militant Islamist group with connections to al Qaeda -- claimed responsibility for the attack . 
   We are behind the martyrdom explosion , ' the group claimed via Twitter .    The Turkish were our main target . ' 
The U.S. government reacted Saturday to    the terrorist attack ' by pledging its solidarity with Turkey ,    the people of Somalia ... and all members of the international community who are working for peace and stability in Somalia . ' 
   This cowardly act will not shake our commitment to continue working for the brighter , more democratic and prosperous future the people of Somalia deserve , ' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement . 
Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamoud similarly blasted what he called    an act of cowardly desperation by terrorists ' against one of his nation 's    most determined and dependable allies . ' He lauded Turks     tireless efforts ' over the past two years to help build new schools and hospitals , among other contributions . 
   I condemn this criminal act of terrorism and my government and security forces will do everything it can to catch those who planned and directed it , ' Hassan said . 
   We must continue to stand firm against those who seek to destroy this country and , with the brave support of our allies , we must double our efforts to deliver the peaceful future the Somali people so desperately want . ' 
Saturday 's bombing was the second major attack in Mogadishu in a few days : On Wednesday , at least one person died in the capital after a bomb hidden in a lawmaker 's car blew up . 
The targeted member of Parliament , Sheikh Adan Mader , and other lawmakers were out of the car when the blast occurred and were unharmed , police said . 
Designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government in 2008 , al-Shabaab has waged a war with Somali 's government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law in the country . 
Its forces were pushed out of Mogadishu in summer 2011 by Somali and other African forces , raising hopes of a return to relative security in a city after about 20 years of violence . 
But the militants have persisted by maintaining control of large rural areas of southern and central Somalia and staging guerrilla-style attacks . In one such attack that al-Shabaab took credit for , in June , at least 14 people died and 15 were wounded in an attack on U.N. headquarters in Mogadishu . 
In addition to its volatile security situation , Somalia has been plagued by famine . 
A May report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the USAID-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network , found that 258,000 Somalis had died in the famine between October 2010 and April 2012 . Half of the famine victims were children younger than 5 . 
Journalist Omar Nor reported from Somalia , and CNN 's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta .
