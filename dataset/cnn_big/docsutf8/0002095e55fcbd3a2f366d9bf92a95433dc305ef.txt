-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Usain Bolt rounded off the world championships Sunday by claiming his third gold in Moscow as he anchored Jamaica to victory in the men 's 4x100m relay . 
The fastest man in the world charged clear of United States rival Justin Gatlin as the Jamaican quartet of Nesta Carter , Kemar Bailey-Cole , Nickel Ashmeade and Bolt won in 37.36 seconds . 
The U.S finished second in 37.56 seconds with Canada taking the bronze after Britain were disqualified for a faulty handover . 
The 26-year-old Bolt has now collected eight gold medals at world championships , equaling the record held by American trio Carl Lewis , Michael Johnson and Allyson Felix , not to mention the small matter of six Olympic titles . 
The relay triumph followed individual successes in the 100 and 200 meters in the Russian capital . 
   I 'm proud of myself and I 'll continue to work to dominate for as long as possible , ' Bolt said , having previously expressed his intention to carry on until the 2016 Rio Olympics . 
Victory was never seriously in doubt once he got the baton safely in hand from Ashmeade , while Gatlin and the United States third leg runner Rakieem Salaam had problems . 
Gatlin strayed out of his lane as he struggled to get full control of their baton and was never able to get on terms with Bolt . 
Earlier , Jamaica 's women underlined their dominance in the sprint events by winning the 4x100m relay gold , anchored by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce , who like Bolt was completing a triple . 
Their quartet recorded a championship record of 41.29 seconds , well clear of France , who crossed the line in second place in 42.73 seconds . 
Defending champions , the United States , were initially back in the bronze medal position after losing time on the second handover between Alexandria Anderson and English Gardner , but promoted to silver when France were subsequently disqualified for an illegal handover . 
The British quartet , who were initially fourth , were promoted to the bronze which eluded their men 's team . 
Fraser-Pryce , like Bolt aged 26 , became the first woman to achieve three golds in the 100-200 and the relay . 
In other final action on the last day of the championships , France 's Teddy Tamgho became the third man to leap over 18m in the triple jump , exceeding the mark by four centimeters to take gold . 
Germany 's Christina Obergfoll finally took gold at global level in the women 's javelin after five previous silvers , while Kenya 's Asbel Kiprop easily won a tactical men 's 1500m final . 
Kiprop 's compatriot Eunice Jepkoech Sum was a surprise winner of the women 's 800m . 
Bolt 's final dash for golden glory brought the eight-day championship to a rousing finale , but while the hosts topped the medal table from the United States there was criticism of the poor attendances in the Luzhniki Stadium . 
There was further concern when their pole vault gold medalist Yelena Isinbayeva made controversial remarks in support of Russia 's new laws , which make    the propagandizing of non-traditional sexual relations among minors ' a criminal offense . 
She later attempted to clarify her comments , but there were renewed calls by gay rights groups for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi , the next major sports event in Russia .
