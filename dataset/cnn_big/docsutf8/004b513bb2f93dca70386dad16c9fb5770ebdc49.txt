The former Rutgers University student convicted of spying on and intimidating his gay roommate was released from jail Tuesday after serving his sentence , a jail official said . 
Dharun Ravi , 20 , was found guilty in May of invasion of privacy , witness tampering , hindering apprehension and bias intimidation . 
He left the Middlesex County Jail in North Brunswick , New Jersey , on Tuesday morning , according to Edmond Cicchi , warden of the Middlesex County Office of Adult Corrections . 
Ravi was released early after jail officials applied five days of good behavior and five days of work credit to his term , Cicchi said . 
Ravi 's former roommate , 18-year-old Tyler Clementi , killed himself by jumping off a New York bridge after learning Ravi had secretly recorded Clementi and his partner with a webcam . 
While Ravi could have been sentenced to 10 years in prison , New Jersey Superior Judge Glenn Berman instead gave him a 30-day jail sentence , three years of probation and ordered him to complete 300 hours of community service aimed at assisting victims of bias crimes . 
The judge said he took Ravi 's youth and his lack of a criminal record into consideration when handing down his sentence . 
Ravi began serving his term on May 31 , two days after apologizing in a written statement for spying on Clementi . 
His lawyer filed a notice of appeal of his conviction earlier this month . 
On Monday , U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement said it would not deport Ravi to his native India . 
The agency is legally prohibited from deporting legal permanent residents unless they have been convicted of crimes such as an aggravated felony , domestic violence or drug or weapons offenses , a spokesman said .
