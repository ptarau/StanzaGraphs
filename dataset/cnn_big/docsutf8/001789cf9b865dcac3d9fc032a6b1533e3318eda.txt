-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A short video that has gone viral in Mexico asks a tough question of the country 's presidential candidates :    Are you striving only for the -LRB- presidential -RRB- chair , or will you change the future of our country ? ' 
A young girl with brown eyes and long brown hair , wearing a simple white shirt , poses the question . Behind her is a small army of child actors who star in the video , which is cute for a moment , but deadly serious . 
In it , the children act out a day in the life of a Mexican resident , fraught with all the problems and challenges that a leader must face . 
A child dressed as a businessman gets robbed at gunpoint as soon as he leaves his home . The robbers hand their loot over to a corrupt police officer . Protesters clash with riot police . There 's a smog alert . Drug traffickers have it out with police on the streets , and human smugglers unload their cargo . 
Seeing children act out these grown-up situations has elicited a number of responses . Some viewers have criticized it as political manipulation , others as a wake-up call . But the list of Mexico 's woes weighs heavily : security , pollution and poverty , among others . 
The video has garnered nearly 2 million views in less than four days . 
   In reality , the video is not reflecting anything that people have not experienced , ' said Rosenda Martinez , a spokeswoman for Our Mexico of the Future , the group behind the production . 
The video targets the major presidential candidates -- Enrique Pena Nieto , Josefina Vazquez Mota and Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador -- and aims to raise awareness about Our Mexico of the Future . 
The goal of the organization is to collect as many    visions ' of Mexico 's future as possible and to compile them in a book that will be presented to the candidates before the election . 
So far , more than 10 million Mexicans have written or recorded their dreams for a safer or cleaner or more tolerant Mexico . 
   We 've had the response we 've hoped for , and even exceeded it , ' Martinez said . 
After the children in the video depict a kidnapping , posters of the missing and people wearing face masks because of smog , the young narrator continues :    If this is the future that awaits me , I do n't want it . Stop working for your party , and not for us . Stop superficially fixing the country . ' 
Some of the candidates have watched the video . 
Vazquez Mota , of the ruling National Action Party , said the video 's message ca n't go unnoticed , while Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate Pena Nieto expressed that now is the time for change , as the video suggests . 
Leftist candidate Lopez Obrador , of the Party of the Democratic Revolution , had not seen the video , but said he agreed with the theme of change . 
Our Mexico of the Future will release data based on the millions of messages it has received . Martinez said to expect that security and the environment are the two most popular themes mentioned by Mexicans .
