Zango Town , Liberia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At the gravesite in a northern Liberia village , there are no religious or traditional burial rites . No ceremony , no mourning , no family members , and no final goodbyes . 
Nothing but a group of men dressed in space-suit-like outfits , cautiously throwing the dead body into the grave , they pause only to toss in anything else they are wearing that came into contact with the deceased . 
These men are part of the country 's Ebola response team , specifically tasked with burying anyone suspected to have died of the Ebola virus . 
The virus is spread through contact with the blood and body fluids of people infected with Ebola , and it is still transferable even from a dead body . 
To help combat the spread of the disease , the Liberian government has directed that its citizens should not bury anyone who dies of , or is suspected of having been infected with , Ebola . 
For months Liberians ignored the directive , fearing that they would be ostracized by their communities if they admitted that their relatives had died of Ebola , but here in Lofa County -- ground zero of the country 's outbreak -- almost everyone has witnessed the devastating suffering and numerous deaths caused by the virus . 
Now almost anytime there is a suspected Ebola death in the community , they call in the Ebola response team to come and bury the body safely . 
Safe burials 
   When it started , it was n't that easy , ' says Alpha Tamba , an Ebola response coordinator in Lofa County .    It was kind of difficult for communities to disclose death . People preferred driving us away . ' 
   We must be grateful for the communities , through the efforts of the local leaders . Now they are disclosing death to us , ' he explains . 
Today , the team has been called to a village where a woman has died of unknown causes . It may not have been from the deadly virus , but the villagers are not taking any chances . 
The Lofa County health team arrives carrying gloves , gowns , goggles and diluted bleach . They suit up : from head to toe , no skin is exposed . On their hands they wear three layers of gloves , securing the edges with clear tape at the wrists . 
Before they enter the house to collect the body , one of them goes in and sprays the house with bleach . Then -- and only then -- can the rest of the team enter to place the body in an airtight polythene bag , ready for burial . 
Wailing rents the air as the burial team walks out of the house carrying the body on a stretcher . Some of those crying are the dead woman 's family members ; for their own safety , they can only mourn from a distance . 
Town abandoned 
A few kilometres away from the village is Zango Town : most of the houses here have been abandoned , their doors padlocked and windows shuttered . 
Some of the residents abandoned the town in such a hurry that their clothes and floor mats have been left hanging on clotheslines . 
Kazalee Johnson , a community worker , tells CNN the empty houses belong to people who either died of Ebola or those who fled in terror , for fear of contracting the virus . 
Johnson says he lost his 8-months-pregnant sister , his brother , niece and many , many others : too many to name . 
   They died . They died , ' he says .    So many people die -- the houses on your right and even the houses on your left . They are all gone , ' says Johnson . 
It 's hard to imagine another area in Lofa county that has been harder hit than this one . 
But then there 's Barkedu Town -- of the 1,000 or so Ebola-related deaths in Liberia , 20 % of the victims have died in this single town . 
Quarantine zone 
Home to more than 8,000 people , Barkedu is now under quarantine : no one can go in , and no one can go out . 
The toll of the isolation is weighing heavily on the community . 
   From the time we started receiving death from Ebola -- every activity cease , ' says Musa Sessay , the town 's chief .    Because we do farm here and now there 's been no farming . ' 
   We need food , we really need medicine . But the most important one is medicine because the hospital is closed down , there is no health worker , ' he says . 
This is what life is like across Lofa : The people are locked in , afraid and alone . 
And not even the health workers are spared the ravaging effects of Ebola . 
Sometimes when they are called in to investigate a case , they get there only to discover the victim is one of their own . 
Ebola nightmares 
One of the local clinics had to be locked up after all the healthcare workers based there contracted the virus . Only one survived . 
   It is very heartbreaking . You are working for the team at the front and you see them lying down . Day by day , they are dying , ' says Tamba , who admits the harrowing work he does has caused him nightmares . 
   Sometimes we go to bed and we dream of nothing else but Ebola , Ebola , Ebola -- nothing else , ' he explains .    Several times I dream I become infected , I see myself in the case management center . ' 
But he says that amid all the bad news , he is beginning to hear happier tidings : an increasing number of Ebola survivors , people who initially tested positive for the virus but -- because they reported it early and because of the medical teams  efforts -- later recovered . 
These positive outcomes keep Tamba hopeful as he and other health workers continue to tirelessly explain to the community how to prevent infection . 
   It is difficult to stand in front of Ebola , but this is the situation we have , ' he says .    We must do everything we can to kick Ebola out of our country . 
   Staying at home or running away from Ebola is not a solution , so we have to face it . We have to fight it . To get it to zero . '
