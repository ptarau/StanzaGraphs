-LRB- CNN -RRB- When photographer Fabio Bucciarelli first visited South Sudan , he found a nation filled with hope . He found citizens worn out by decades of war -- but looking forward to an independent , peaceful future . 
That was two years ago , after the world 's youngest country split from its northern nemesis , Sudan . 
   I remember the look on people 's faces , ' Bucciarelli said .    Tired but happy , hopeful for a better future after a past full of pain and war . ' 
His return in February was anything but . 
This time , Bucciarelli found a nation on the brink of an abyss . Instead of jubilant faces of hope , he saw defeated faces haunted by a return of ghosts of past wars . 
Months of ethnic violence had left thousands dead , 1.5 million people displaced and a looming famine , according to the United Nations . 
Bucciarelli found despair cramped in tent camps , growing sexual violence and the recruitment of child soldiers . 
He described the violence in South Sudan as an    invisible ' conflict . 
   It represents one of the longest and most forgotten African wars , ' he said .    Its apparent stillness leads to hear about it less and less . Given the tragic consequences and repercussions on the population , I find it essential to bring it to light . ' 
His goal , he said , is to tell the stories of people rendered powerless by wars , provide objective images and shed light on human rights issues . 
   It 's hard to find front-line war photography of the kind we 've seen in Libya or Syria , ' Bucciarelli said .    The images in South Sudan are different . They describe visually the effect of the impending war , lending you a view of the civilian and military populations and providing a glimpse of life inside a murky , not clearly defined conflict . ' 
The latest conflict erupted in December last year , when President Salva Kiir accused his fired deputy , Riek Machar , of an attempted coup . Since then , militia loyal to both have battled each other and targeted civilians from rival tribes . 
The conflict has wiped out entire neighborhoods and transformed into a full-blown war between two large tribes , the Nuer and the Dinka . Machar belongs to the Nuer community , while the President is a Dinka . 
Bucciarelli 's pictures provide a rare window into a civilian population under siege . 
   South Sudan 's war represents one of the longest and most forgotten African conflicts , ' he said .    Its tragic consequences are quietly fading away from the headlines , making these pictures even more crucial . '

South Sudan split from Sudan in 2011 as part of a peace deal that ended decades of war in Africa 's largest nation . That war left 2 million people dead and ended with the peace agreement that included an independence referendum for the south . 
The recent clashes have been a major setback for a country so desperate for a new start . 
Instead of relishing its independence , residents of areas such as Bentiu , Bor , Nyang and Mingkaman are struggling to survive as communities turn against one another . 
Concerned neighboring nations have stepped in and urged warring parties to sign ceasefire deals , but the weapons have not gone quiet . 
Frantic international pleas for peace have gone unheeded .
