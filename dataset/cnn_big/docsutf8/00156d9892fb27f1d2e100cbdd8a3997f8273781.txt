Most of those who fell ill are more than 60 years old , the CDC said . Doctors also are closely monitoring the pregnancies of two women who ate contaminated cantaloupe , with the agency noting that listeriosis can cause miscarriages and stillbirths .

The grower , Jensen Farms , issued a recall for its Rocky Ford-brand cantaloupes on September 14 . By now , the cantaloupes should all be off store shelves , the CDC said .
