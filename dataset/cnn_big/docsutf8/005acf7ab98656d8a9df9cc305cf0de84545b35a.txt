LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- London commuters crammed onto buses , scrambled for taxis , cycled or simply walked on Wednesday as a strike by Tube workers shut down most of the subway network . 
Commuters queue for packed buses in London on Wednesday morning . 
The strike began Tuesday at 7 p.m. -LRB- 2 p.m. ET -RRB- but the first full effects were felt during Wednesday 's morning commute . The strike was set to last for 48 hours with a normal service resuming Friday morning , according to Transport for London -LRB- TfL -RRB- , which runs the city 's transportation network . 
The RMT trade union called the strike after talks with management over pay , job cuts , and disciplinary issues broke down . 
   RMT does n't resort to industrial action lightly , ' General Secretary Bob Crow said in a statement .    The fact is that Tube workers have been driven into walking out today . ' 
Transport Commissioner Peter Hardy said the talks had been making progress on all issues and he urged the RMT to return to the table . 
   The RMT leadership says we were close to a deal , ' Hardy said in a statement .    If that is the case , then they should call off the strike , return to talks ... and resolve this issue without any more disruption to Londoners . ' 
TfL was running extra buses and free shuttle services across the River Thames during the strike . Electronic travel cards used for the TfL network were temporarily being allowed on all train lines in greater London , it said . 
While most services on the Tube were shut because of the strike , one line -- the Northern line -- was running normally and five others were running on a reduced schedule , TfL said . 
   It 's been really good , ' a girl on Oxford Street told CNN about her commute .    The Northern line is running perfectly . ' 
Still , some bus services were packed with commuters who normally ride the underground trains or who failed to find a taxi . 
   I think we 'd all like to strike for more money , but unfortunately we ca n't , ' said one woman at Oxford Circus , where the Tube is closed . 
Others hit the pavement and walked . 
   It 's OK -- quite refreshing , ' said a man on Regent Street . He said he had just walked from Liverpool Street Station , a train station as well as a Tube stop that is more than 2.5 miles away . 
The RMT represents about half of the 20,000 employees on the Tube , a TfL spokeswoman said . Other unions including Unite and TSSA represent the rest , she said , and were not on strike .
