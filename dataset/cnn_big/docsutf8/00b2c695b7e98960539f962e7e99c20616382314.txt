-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Beset by war and sectarian violence , Iraq has not had a lot to laugh about in recent years . 
But a trio of old friends from Baghdad have sought to change that , by distilling the jokey banter of their late-night drinking sessions into a controversial talk show . 
Hosted by Yasser Sami and Walid Monam , and produced by their friend Ghazwan Al-Shawi , the show is called    Akou Fad Wahad ' --    There is this guy ' -- the typical setup for one of their anecdotes . 
The aim behind the production , says Al-Shawi ,    was to make people smile . ' 
   We wanted to do anything to make miserable and sad people happy , ' he said . 
But while it 's proved a hit with their predominantly male audience , not everyone appreciates their sense of humor . 
Sami describes the first episode , broadcast in the summer of 2011 , as    very bold . ' 
   It got us into a lot of trouble because there was sexual and pornographic innuendos , so it was like a shock for all Iraqis , ' he laughs . 
Since then , the show has routinely offended the conservative sectors of Iraqi society with its discussion of taboo topics including relationships and sex . A religious group staged a demonstration outside the show 's studio last year , and government censors complained about the content .

Sami said a gang even turned up at his house , threatening him .    I ca n't tell you -LRB- who -RRB- because this means I will give them another chance to come to me again , ' he laughs . 
The jokes might not be considered particularly edgy to non-Iraqis -- or even necessarily that funny . A typical gag goes like this :    A stoned guy bought two birds for his mother , one tweeting and the other silent . She asks ,   Son , why is it that only one of them that is tweeting ?    Mother , the other one is the composer ,  he replied . ' 
But although the humor may seem mild , Iraq is not yet ready for    Akou Wad Fahad . ' Sami says the team has had to modify their approach in order to continue broadcasting . 
   We changed things in the show , ' he said .    We used to have a female DJ , but we were asked to remove her from the show , and we did . ' 
Even in the new Iraq , said Monam , there are still many    red lines ' that can not be crossed in entertainment .    Were it not for the limitations that are imposed on us , it would be a much better show . But we have to live with social taboos , ' he said . 
Challenging this , he says , is    impossible , ' at least for now . But as frustrating as it might be , he and his friends are content to tone down their act , if it means bringing a smile to people 's faces .
