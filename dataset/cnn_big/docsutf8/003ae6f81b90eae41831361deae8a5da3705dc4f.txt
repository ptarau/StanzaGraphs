An 11-year-old boy 's rendition of the national anthem at Game 3 of the NBA finals brought the usual appreciative applause Tuesday , but outside AT&T Center in San Antonio , his performance brought a darker reaction from some posters on social media -- and eventually an online backlash against their racist comments .

Here 's a sampling of some of the unkind tweets that went flying around the Internet about Sebastien de la Cruz : 
--    Why they got a Mexican kid singing the national anthem - ___ - ' from Daniel Gilmore . 
--    How you singing the national anthem looking like an illegal immigrant ' from Andre Lacey , proud father and firefighter from Augusta , Georgia . 
--    Why is a foreigner singing the national anthem . I realize that 's San Antonio but that still ai n't Mexico ' from Lewie Groh . 
--    Who let this illegal alien sing our national anthem ? ' from Matt Cyrus . 
And the list went on and on . 
As for Sebastien , he said the racist comments have not fazed him . 
   For those that said something bad about me , I understand it 's your opinion , ' said Sebastien to CNN .    I 'm a proud American and live in a free country . It 's not hurting me . It 's just your opinion . ' 
Sebastien has been singing since he was 5 but gained fame in 2012 after being on NBC 's    America 's Got Talent ' for singing his mariachi ballads with hopes of winning to help his younger brother get surgery for his hearing problem . 
Juan de la Cruz , Sebastien 's father , has n't taken the negative comments personally at all . 
   When he was on   America 's Got Talent ,  he faced racism there , too . You ca n't satisfy everyone , ' said de la Cruz to CNN . 
   I think people reacted the way they did because Sebastien was wearing his mariachi outfit , ' said de la Cruz ,    But , it does n't make sense to listen to those people when most of the feedback we have gotten is positive . San Antonio supports Sebastien . ' 
A collection of the negative tweets was posted on Public Shaming , a Tumblr blog dedicated to outing and shaming racists  social media posts . Other media outlets used that post as the foundation for the story , and the story took off from there . 
The blog highlighted 28 tweets from NBA fans who came off as offended and ashamed that the Spurs would allow the boy , who happened to have been born and raised in San Antonio , to sing the nation 's anthem . 
However , Public Shaming must have suspected what would happen once the racist tweets were posted because most of the Twitter handles have been deactivated or the tweet has been removed . The blog posted screen shots of the tweets so it could continue to display the public microbloggers  rants . 
After the harsh reaction spread across the Internet , tweets supporting and defending Sebastien and vociferously denouncing his critics started to take over : 
--    That little 10 year old mariachi National Anthem singer has more talent and grace than the combined racist pig idiots on Twitter , ' from Mexican-American cartoonist Lalo Alcaraz 
--    Racist scumbag says Chicano kid singing nat'l anthem just    snuck into the country . ' This idiot 's apparently of color too . @A2daO , ' from Laura Gonzalez , a Chicana Santa Rosa City Schools board member and middle school teacher . 
--    Why are ppl so upset over a Hispanic singing the national anthem . He 's probably got more roots in here than most   Americans  , ' said Amanda Aguirre on Twitter . 
-- And , from the American Latino Museum ,    We 're proud of the 11-year old San Anto-native Sebastien de la Cruz for his amazing performance last night ! ' 
San Antonio is a multicultural city with more than 55 % of the population being Hispanic and 90 % of those people identifying themselves as Mexican according to the Pew Hispanic Center . 
For some Mexican-Americans , the incident was just the latest sign of a persistent problem they face : being treated as outsiders in their own country . 
   To see people acting this way does n't make sense anymore . It 's a demographic fact that the country is changing and Latinos are going to be behind that economic push that moves everyone forward , ' said Chon Noriega , director of the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center , to CNN .    Cities like San Antonio are defining a trend of a nation . ' 
That the word    Mexican ' is being used as a derogatory term is part of the problem , said Noriega ,    It 's become the N-word of Mexican descent . Yet it 's also the name of a group of people in a neighboring country . ' 
It will take a lot more than some racist tweets to bring Sebastien down . 
The    boy with the golden voice ' tweeted earlier today :    Please do not pay attention to the negative people . I am an American living the American Dream . This is part of the American life . ' 
Sebastien said today was like any other day , but he 's always grateful to wake up to yet another day able to sing . He said he owes his positive outlook to his parents , family and everyone in San Antonio .
