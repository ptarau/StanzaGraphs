WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney on Sunday defended the Bush administration 's economic record , the invasion of Iraq and the treatment of suspected terrorists , warning that reversing its anti-terrorism policies endangers Americans . 
   We 've accomplished nearly everything we set out to do , ' ex-Vice President Dick Cheney says Sunday about Iraq . 
In a wide-ranging interview with CNN 's    State of the Union , ' Cheney said the harsh interrogations of suspects and the use of warrantless electronic surveillance were    absolutely essential ' to get information to prevent more attacks like the 2001 suicide hijackings that targeted New York and Washington . 
   President Obama campaigned against it all across the country , and now he is making some choices that , in my mind , will , in fact , raise the risk to the American people of another attack , ' he said . 
Critics said the Bush administration 's    alternative ' interrogation techniques amounted to the torture of prisoners in American custody , while the administration 's warrantless surveillance program violated federal laws enacted after the Watergate scandal . 
Since taking office in January , Obama has announced plans to close the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , to halt the military trials of suspected terrorists there , and to make CIA officers follow the Army field manual 's rules on interrogations . Cheney said the administration appears to be returning to the pre-2001 model of treating terrorism as a law enforcement issue , rather than a military problem . 
   When you go back to the law enforcement mode , which I sense is what they 're doing , closing Guantanamo and so forth ... they are very much giving up that center of attention and focus that 's required , that concept of military threat that is essential if you 're going to successfully defend the nation against further attacks , ' he said . 
But Rep. Joe Sestak , D-Pennsylvania , said the Bush administration 's policies undercut    what is actually the source of America 's greatness -- our principles . ' 
   How can we say that keeping a man in a black hole forever -- perpetually in a black hole -- and saying ,   Let 's torture when we decide to ,  is what America stands for ? ' asked Sestak , a former admiral who led the Navy 's anti-terrorism efforts . 
The Bush administration took office at the end of an economic boom and left in the middle of a deep recession , with a budget surplus in 2001 becoming a $ 1 trillion-plus deficit by 2009 . But Cheney said he and Bush had to spend money to deal with the September 11 , 2001 attacks , the resulting war in Afghanistan , the disaster of 2005 's Hurricane Katrina , and the costly and unpopular war in Iraq , now nearly six years old . 
   All of these things required us to spend money that we had not originally planned to spend , or were n't originally part of the budget , ' Cheney said .    Stuff happens . And the administration has to be able to respond to that , and we did . ' 
Obama has begun to wind down the war in Iraq , which has cost more than 4,200 American lives and nearly $ 700 billion in direct costs . But Cheney said the United States has    accomplished nearly everything we set out to do ' in Iraq , including establishing a democratic government in the Middle East . 
Cheney was one of the administration 's leading advocates of the 2003 invasion of Iraq , pressing the Bush administration 's argument that Iraq was concealing weapons of mass destruction and could provide those weapons to terrorists . None of those weapons were found after the invasion , but Cheney said ,    We 've eliminated that possibility . ' 
In 2005 , Cheney said the raging insurgency against U.S. troops was in its    last throes . ' Nearly two years later , a commitment of more than 30,000 additional American troops and a widespread effort to pay former insurgents to turn against Islamic militants helped quell the worst of the violence . 
   I do n't hear much talk about that , but the fact is , the violence level is down 90 percent , ' Cheney said .    The number of casualties -LSB- among -RSB- Iraqis and Americans is significantly diminished . There 's been elections , a constitution . They 're about to have another presidential election here in the near future . We have succeeded in creating in the heart of the Middle East a democratically governed Iraq , and that is a big deal , and it is , in fact , what we set out to do . ' 
But Sestak said the administration was too slow to react to the problems it faced in Iraq and let the conflict overshadow the    whole fabric ' of U.S. national security . 
   The cost of this war is something that I strongly believe has far , far hurt us , ' he said .    We 're going to recover , because we 're Americans . But Iraq was just one piece of our security , and this administration failed to realize that . ' 
Though considered one of the administration 's most influential figures , Cheney said President Bush rebuffed his advice on at least two issues . Watch Cheney tout Bush administration ' 
He said Bush left former Cheney aide Lewis    Scooter ' Libby    sort of hanging in the wind ' by refusing to issue Libby a pardon before leaving office . Libby was convicted of perjury , obstruction of justice , and lying to federal agents investigating the leak of a former CIA officer 's identity . 
   I believe firmly that Scooter was unjustly accused and prosecuted and deserved a pardon , and the president disagreed with that , ' Cheney said . He would disclose no details of his efforts to lobby the president on Libby 's behalf , saying they would be    best left to history . ' 
And Cheney said he argued against the administration 's policy on North Korea , which tested a nuclear weapon in 2006 . The Bush administration reached a still-incomplete disarmament deal with the isolated Stalinist state in 2007 and removed it from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism as part of the deal . 
   I had my say , ' Cheney told CNN .    I got my chance to voice my views and my objections . I did n't think the North Koreans were going to keep their end of the bargain in terms of what they agreed to , and they did n't . ' 
The Obama administration has nominated Christopher Hill , the State Department official who was the top U.S. negotiator with North Korea , to be the U.S. ambassador to Iraq . Cheney said Hill lacks the Middle East experience that his predecessors have , and    I did not support the work that Chris Hill did with respect to North Korea . ' 
   I think it 's a choice that I would n't have made , ' he said .
