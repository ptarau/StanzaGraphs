-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If you travel by plane and arriving on time makes a difference , try to book on Hawaiian Airlines . In 2012 , passengers got where they needed to go without delay on the carrier more than nine times out of 10 , according to a study released on Monday . 
In fact , Hawaiian got even better from 2011 , when it had a 92.8 % on-time performance . Last year , it improved to 93.4 % . 
The Airline Quality Rankings Report looks at the 14 largest U.S. airlines and is based on an analysis of U.S. Department of Transportation figures . It 's co-authored by Brent Bowen , the head of the Department of Aviation Technology at Purdue University , and Dean Headley of Wichita State . 
In addition to on-time performance , the joint project looks at three other categories : rate of consumer complaints , mishandled bags and denied boarding performance .

Eight airlines improved their on-time arrival performance in 2012 . Nine of the 14 rated had an on-time arrival percentage of more than 80 % . 
ExpressJet and American Airlines had the worst on-time performance -LRB- 76.9 % -RRB- last year , according to the data gathered in the 23rd annual report . 
Virgin America had the best baggage handling rate of all the airlines -LRB- 0.87 misplaced bags per 1,000 passengers . -RRB- American Eagle showed improvement from 2011 but still came in last , fumbling baggage at a rate of 5.80 mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers .
