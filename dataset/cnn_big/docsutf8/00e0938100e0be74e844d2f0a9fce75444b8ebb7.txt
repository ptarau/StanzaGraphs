-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- So many visitors to Turkey see little more than the beautiful but crowded Mediterranean coast or the great mosques and palaces of Istanbul . 
But the country is huge , and there are many more attractions away from the tourist hotspots . 
Relics of vanished civilizations , a vast inland sea with a water-loving cat and a Biblical mountain with views deep into Iran and Armenia are just some of the reasons to go . 
1 . See it all from a train 
For people who like intrepid journeys but like them even more when they 're sitting or lying down , the Turkish rail system is heaven . 
From February 2014 , if all goes to plan , you 'll be able to whiz between Istanbul and Ankara , Turkey 's capital , on a new high speed train . 
East of Ankara the pace slows . 
The Dogu Expresi -LRB- Eastern Express -RRB- leaves nightly at 6 p.m. and takes just more than 24 hours to trundle from Ankara to Kars , almost 1,500 kilometers away in the remote northeast . 
It stops at the cities of Kayseri , Sivas and Erzurum , passes through the rolling fields of Anatolia and ends among snow-topped eastern mountains . 
The two-berth cabins have a mini-fridge stocked with mineral water and soft drinks , and washbasins with hot and cold running water . 
A porter makes your bed and brings drinks and snacks during the day , and there 's a dining car . 
You can book online at Turkish State Railways , or by phone -LRB- +90 0216 337 8724 -RRB- , but the English version of the site is clunky -- it 's easier to book through a travel agent or buy tickets at a station . 
Tickets cost $ 45 in a one-berth cabin on the Ankara-Kars route . 
2 . Hunt rare ruins 
It sometimes feels that you ca n't walk more than a few paces in Turkey without stubbing your toe on some millennia-old relic . 
Some sites -- such as ever-popular Ephesus -- are packed with visitors almost all year round . 
But remarkably few people visit the equally spectacular Aphrodisias , where you can wander around a square kilometer of ruined temples and theaters with only tortoises for company . 
The site reached its zenith around 2,000 years ago , when it was famed for its sculptors . 
You can see some of their work in the excellent on-site museum . 
Aphrodisias is around 160 kilometers from the coastal resorts of Bodrum , Marmaris or Kusadasi . The easiest way to get there is by car , and car rental is available at all resorts and at Dalaman Airport . 
Ancient Aphrodisias , Geyre Bedesi , Karcasu ; +90 256 448 8003 ; open -LRB- site and museum -RRB- April-October , daily 10 a.m.-7 p.m. ; November-March , daily 10 a.m.-5 p.m. ; admission TL10 -LRB- $ 4.50 -RRB- 
3 . Sail an inland sea 
Up to 400 meters deep and almost 120 kilometers across , Lake Van is a true inland sea . 
With no outlet , its waters are saturated with mineral salts that turn the shallows milky blue . 
In its depths , colonies of extremophile bacteria form weird , 40-meter-high towers . 
Only one kind of fish -- pearl mullet or inci kefali -- has adapted to live in its hyper-alkaline waters . 
Van is also famous for a breed of water-loving and often odd-eyed cat , and is rumored to have its own monster . 
You can swim in the shallows , where it 's almost impossible to sink beneath the surface . 
More than a thousand years ago , the lake was part of the kingdom of Armenia . 
The ancient Armenian Surb Kach -LRB- Holy Cross -RRB- church on Akdamar Island , three kilometers from thev lake shore , has remarkable frescoes and carvings , which have recently been restored . 
It can be visited by a combination of dolmus and small boat from Gevas , about 50 kilometers from Van . 
Grand Deniz Turizm , Van-Tatvan Highway , 40 kilometers from GevaÅŸ and Van -LRB- +90 432 612 4038 -RRB- , offers boat trips to Akdamar and other islands in the lake . 
4 . Cycle among mountains 
Turkey has thousands of miles of mountain and forest trails . 
Some of the most spectacular cycling country is in the Kackar mountain range and the valley of the River Coruh , where you can also go whitewater rafting . 
With several peaks rising well above 3,000 meters -LRB- the highest , Kackardagi , is 3,932 meters high -RRB- , these mountains are snow-covered much of the year . 
In summer -- the best time to visit is June to August -- they 're cooler than better known cycling spots closer to the Med . 
For a really big adventure , you can follow mountain roads all the way down to the Black Sea coast and fly back to Istanbul or Ankara from Trabzon . 
You can fly to Erzurum from Istanbul or Ankara , or take the train -LRB- see above -RRB- . 
The Coruh Valley is around 120 kilometers north of Erzurum and more than a thousand kilometers east of Istanbul . 
5 . Follow an epic walking trail 
The Lycian Way feels like a path trodden by the ancients but in fact this walking route stretching from the Aegean coast to the Mediterranean was pioneered in 2000 by an Antalya-based expat , Kate Clow . 
For most of its length , it parallels the Lycian coast , but it soars to 1,800 meters above sea level at its highest point , the shoulder of Tahtali Dag -LRB- Mt Tahtali -RRB- . 
The best place to start -LRB- or finish -RRB- is the small resort of Olu Deniz -- there are village guesthouses and campsites along the way . 
You need at least four weeks to walk the entire 509-kilometer distance , but public transport is plentiful -- so you can walk for a week , or even just for a day or two . 
Several airlines fly to both Dalaman -LRB- about 50 kilometers from Olu Deniz -RRB- and Antalya from Istanbul and direct from European airports . 
Best times to go are April-May and October .

6 . Climb Mt. Ararat 
Noah 's Ark is said to have come to rest on top of Turkey 's highest mountain , the 5,137-meter Agri Dagi -LRB- Mt. Ararat -RRB- . 
Some believe it 's still there . 
From the summit of Ararat , you can see a vast swath of Turkey and deep into Iran and Armenia . 
Ararat is a hard slog , requiring some technical mountain skills . 
The terrain is rugged , and climbers must contend with extremes of heat and cold -- the highest summit is snow-covered all year , and summer temperatures at the foot of the mountain can reach more than 30 C. 
It 's essential to go with a trustworthy specialist company , avoiding amateur local guides who claim to know the mountain but lack skills needed for a safe trip . 
Getting to the top and back takes at least five days , using mules to carry tents and supplies . 
The ascent starts from the the city of Dogubayazit , about 1,500 kilometers east of Istanbul . 
Nearest major airports are at Erzurum and Van , both around 4-5 hours  drive .

Getting around 
Travel in Turkey is affordable and efficient . 
If you mix and match road , rail and air transport , there 's no part of the country you ca n't reach . 
Every town has its otogar -LRB- bus station -RRB- , from which air-conditioned , long-distance coaches zoom to all points of the compass . 
On board , you can expect free tea , soft drinks , water , snacks and a squirt of eau de cologne from smartly dressed stewards . 
You can buy tickets in advance , but you should shop around for the best fare , because several lines compete on each route . 
For shorter journeys , you can pile into a dolmus . These minibuses run on fixed routes , but not at fixed times -- they leave when they 're full .
