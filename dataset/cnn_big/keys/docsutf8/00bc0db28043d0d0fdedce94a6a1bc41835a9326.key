David Frum : Most inaugural speeches are full of rhetoric , lack real inspiration 
He says they tend to promise great things but are vague on specific commitments 
There are noble speeches that get undermined by lack of accomplishment , Frum says 
Frum : We remember great speeches of Lincoln , FDR because of their great deeds
