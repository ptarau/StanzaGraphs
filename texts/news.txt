BigScience Bloom is open science and open source.

Now there is a true open-source alternative to GPT-3, BigScience Bloom, which is freely available for research and enterprise purposes. Bloom was trained over 117 days at the supercomputing center of the French National Center for Scientific Research and is 176 billion parameters in size.

The development involved over 1000 volunteer researchers, organized in the BigScience project, coordinated by Hugging Face, and co-funded by the French government.

Bloom can be downloaded for free on Hugging Face and is said to be on par with GPT-3 for accuracy â€“ and also toxicity. A key difference from GPT-3 is a stronger focus on languages away from the otherwise dominant English language.

Bloom can process 46 different languages, including French, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Indonesian, Catalan, 13 Indian languages (such as Hindi) and 20 African languages. BigScience collected numerous new datasets for this and is publishing full details on datasets, development and training of Bloom.

The release falls under the Responsible AI License developed by BigScience, which prohibits the use of Bloom in areas such as law enforcement, healthcare, or deception. However, unlike OpenAI, for example, BigScience has no way to effectively prevent misuse because the model is available directly and not through an interface.

Bloom is now expected to serve as the foundation for numerous applications and, more importantly, research projects that create alternative AI applications away from the big tech companies.
