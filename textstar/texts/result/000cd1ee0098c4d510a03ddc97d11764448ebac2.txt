The police said that the head of a boy was found in a forest a kilometer from his home Saturday morning.
Kamal Prasad Kharel, Police chief of Baitadi district, said he feared the actual number of people killed by the leopard could be higher than 15. In Uttarkhand state in northern India, other people have lost their life to leopard attacks.
The others are older children and a 29-year-old woman who had gone to collect fodder for domestic animals in the nearby forest, a common practice in Nepal.
