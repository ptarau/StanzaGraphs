A political backlash against bringing any of the detainees to the United States has increased the focus on sending them to other countries.. A Justice Department statement said the detainees did not travel to Afghanistan with the intent of taking any hostile action against the United States.
Manning said the 17 were picked up as a matter of circumstance and never had terrorist training.. The 17 Uyghurs had left China and made their way to Afghanistan, where they settled in a camp with other Uyghurs opposed to the Chinese government.
