The 52 men and 14 boys rescued after being found chained this week at a madrassa in Pakistan have been returned to their families or placed in shelters.
The group was found in a basement room with heavy chains linking them together.
Officials said the facility was part madrassa and part drug-rehab facility.
Many of the captives told police their families sent them there because they were recovering drug addicts, and they were chained at night to prevent their escape.
