-LRB- CNN -RRB- For the second time during his papacy , Pope Francis has announced a new group of bishops and archbishops set to become cardinals -- and they come from all over the world . 
Pope Francis said Sunday that he would hold a meeting of cardinals on February 14    during which I will name 15 new Cardinals who , coming from 13 countries from every continent , manifest the indissoluble links between the Church of Rome and the particular Churches present in the world , ' according to Vatican Radio . 
New cardinals are always important because they set the tone in the church and also elect the next pope , CNN Senior Vatican Analyst John L. Allen said . They are sometimes referred to as the princes of the Catholic Church . 
The new cardinals come from countries such as Ethiopia , New Zealand and Myanmar . 
   This is a pope who very much wants to reach out to people on the margins , and you clearly see that in this set , ' Allen said .    You 're talking about cardinals from typically overlooked places , like Cape Verde , the Pacific island of Tonga , Panama , Thailand , Uruguay . ' 
But for the second time since Francis  election , no Americans made the list . 
   Francis  pattern is very clear : He wants to go to the geographical peripheries rather than places that are already top-heavy with cardinals , ' Allen said . 
Christopher Bellitto , a professor of church history at Kean University in New Jersey , noted that Francis announced his new slate of cardinals on the Catholic Feast of the Epiphany , which commemorates the visit of the Magi to Jesus  birthplace in Bethlehem . 
   On feast of three wise men from far away , the Pope 's choices for cardinal say that every local church deserves a place at the big table . ' 
In other words , Francis wants a more decentralized church and wants to hear reform ideas from small communities that sit far from Catholicism 's power centers , Bellitto said . 
That does n't mean Francis is the first pontiff to appoint cardinals from the developing world , though . Beginning in the 1920s , an increasing number of Latin American churchmen were named cardinals , and in the 1960s , St. John XXIII , whom Francis canonized last year , appointed the first cardinals from Japan , the Philippines and Africa . 
In addition to the 15 new cardinals Francis named on Sunday , five retired archbishops and bishops will also be honored as cardinals . 
Last year , Pope Francis appointed 19 new cardinals , including bishops from Haiti and Burkina Faso .
